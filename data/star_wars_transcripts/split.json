The JEDI lower their hoods and look out a large window\nat the lush green planet of Naboo. QUI-GON sixty years old, has long white\nhair in a ponytail. He is tall and striking, with blue eyes. OBI-WAN is\ntwenty five, with very short brown hair, pale skin, and blue eyes. Several\nexotic, bird-like creatures SING in a cage near the door.\n\nOBI-WAN : I have a bad feeling about this.\nQUI-GON : I don't sense anything.\nOBI-WAN : It's not about the mission, Master, it's\nsomethging...elsewhere...elusive.\nQUI-GON : Don't center on your anxiety, Obi-Wan. Keep your concentration\nhere and now where it belongs.\nOBI-WAN : Master Yoda says I should be mindful of the future...\nQUI-GON : .....but not at the expense of the moment.

BATTLE DROIDS cock their\nweapons as a figure stumbles out of the smoke. It is TC-14 , carrying the\ntray of drinks.\n\nTC14 : Oh, excuse me, so sorry.\n\nThe PROTOCOL DROID passes the armed camp just as two flashing laser swords\nfly out of the deadly fog, cutting down several BATTLE DROIDS before they\ncan fire.",

A THIRD RACER, HABBA, flie into the cloud of\ndust and crashes into OBITOKI. ANAKIN rounds a corner and heads into the\ncloud of smoke. He hits a part of one of the engines but regains control.\n\nFODE/BEED : - (O.S.)\nB :At the start of the third and final lap, Sebulba is in the lead, closely\nfollowed by Skywalker...\n\nANAKIN finally catches up with SEBULBA, and runs neck and neck over the\nrough terrain. JAR JAR, QUI-GON, SHMI, and PADME all SCREAM s ANAKIN comes\nthrough the arena. The lights in the tower indicate that this is the third\nand last lap. WATTO begins to worry.\nSEBULBA uses his side exhaust port to try to cut through Anakin's engines.\nANAKIN manages to avoid having his engine disabled but is forced off\ncourse.\n\nFODE/BEED : - (O.S.)\nB : Skywalker is forced onto the service ramp!\nA : Oh noah!\n\nOn a tight corner, ANAKIN dives to the inside and takes the lead.\n\nFODE BEED : - (O.S.)\nB : Amazing... a controlled thrust and he's back on course! What a move!\n\nSEBULBA is furious. He stay's right on Anakin's tail, crowding him and\npushing him through the turns.\nSEBULBA pushes ANAKIN harder, and the young boy has a difficult time\nkeeping control. One of the parts on Anakin's engines begins to shake\nloose. ANAKIN sees it and switches over to an auxiliary system. While he is\ntrying to accomplish this maneuver, SEBULBA races past him.\nANAKIN tries to get around SEBULBA, to no avail. Every move ANAKIN makes,\nSEBULBA is able to block.\nFinally, ANAKIN fakes a move into the inside as he usually does, then tries\nto go around SEBULBA on the outside. They race sid by side down the final\nstretch of the track.\n\nFODE/BEED : - (O.S.)\nB : He's catching Sebulba.\nA : Inkabunga. (Incredible!)\n\nSEBULBA veers toward ANAKIN and bangs into his Pod. He crashes into ANAKIN\nover and over. The young boy struggles to maintain control as the steering\nrods on the two Pods become hooked together. SEBULBA laughs at ANAKIN.\n\nFODE/BEED : - (O.S.)\nB : That little human being is out of his mind.\nA : Punda tah punda! (They're neck and neck!)\nB : They're side by side!\nA : Bongo du bongu! (Shoulder to shoulder!)\n\nAs they head for the final stretch, ANAKIN fights to unlock the steering\nrods by trying to pull away from SEBULBA. The strain on the steering rod is\ntremendous. Suddenly, ANAKIN's steering arm breaks, and his Pos starts\nspinning.\nThe release of tension sends SEBULBA into an ancient statue. One engine\nEXPLODES, then the other. SEBULBA skids through the fire-balls, blackened,\nbut unhurt. He slides to a smoking stop, gets out of his racer, and throws\nwhat's left of a shifter arm on the ground. Suddenly he realizes his pants\nare on fire, and he struggles to put them out. ANAKIN flies through the\nEXPLOSION as the crowd stands, CHERRING.

He\n               really is in first-class condition.\n               I've worked with him before. Here\n               he comes.\n\n     Owen pays off the whining Jawa as Luke and the two robots\n     trudge off toward a grimy homestead entry.\n\n                         LUKE\n               Okay, let's go.\n\n                         THREEPIO\n                   (to Artoo)\n               Now, don't you forget this!

    "The garage is cluttered and worn, but a friendly peaceful\n     atmosphere permeates the low grey chamber. Threepio lowers\n     himself into a large tub filled with warm oil. Near the\n     battered Landspeeder little Artoo rests on a large battery\n     with a cord to his face.\n\n                         THREEPIO\n               Thank the maker! This oil bath is\n               going to feel so good. I've got\n               such a bad case of dust\n               contamination, I can barely move!\n\nArtoo beeps a muffled reply.

Actually, there's\n          not much to tell. I'm not much more\n          than an interpreter, and not very\n          good at telling stories. Well, not\n          at making them interesting,\n          anyways.\n\nLuke struggles to remove a small metal fragment from Artoo's\nneck joint. He uses a larger pick.\n\n                    LUKE\n          Well, my little friend, you've got\n          something jammed in here real good.\n          Were you on a cruiser or...\n\nThe fragment breaks loose with a snap, sending Luke tumbling\nhead over heels. He sits up and sees a twelve-inch three-\ndimensional hologram of Leia Organa, the Rebel senator,\nbeing projected from the face of little Artoo. The image is\na rainbow of colors as it flickers and jiggles in the dimly\nlit garage. Luke's mouth hangs open in awe.\n\n                     LEIA\n          Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my\n          only hope.\n\n                    LUKE\n          What's this?\n\nArtoo looks around and sheepishly beeps an answer for\nThreepio to translate. Leia continues to repeat the sentence\nfragment over and over.\n\n                    THREEPIO\n          What is what?!? He asked you a\n          question...\n              (pointing to Leia)\n          What is that?\n\nArtoo whistles his surprise as he pretends to just notice\nthe hologram. He looks around and sheepishly beeps an answer\nfor Threepio to translate. Leia continues to repeat the\nsentence fragment over and over.\n\n                    LEIA\n          Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my\n          only hope.

She's beautiful.\n\n                    THREEPIO\n          I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.\n\n                    LEIA\n          Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi...\n\n                    THREEPIO\n          I think she was a passenger on our\n          last voyage.

Our\n          captain was attached to...\n\n                    LUKE\n          Is there more to this recording?\n\nLuke reaches out for Artoo but he lets out several frantic\nsqueaks and a whistle.\n\n                    THREEPIO\n          Behave yourself, Artoo. You're\n          going to get us in trouble. It's\n          all right, you can trust him. He's\n          our new master.\n\nArtoo whistles and beeps a long message to Threepio.\n\n                    THREEPIO (CONT’D)\n          He says he's the property of Obi-\n          Wan Kenobi, a resident of these\n          parts. And it's a private message\n          for him. Quite frankly, sir I don't\n          know what he's talking about. Our\n          last master was Captain Antilles,\n          but with what we've been through,\n          this little R2 unit has become a\n          bit eccentric.\n\n                    LUKE\n          Obi-Wan Kenobi? I wonder if he\n          means old Ben Kenobi?\n\n                    THREEPIO\n          I beg your pardon, sir, but do you\n          know what he's talking about?\n\n                    LUKE\n          Well, I don't know anyone named Obi-\n          Wan, but old Ben lives out beyond\n          the dune sea. He's kind of a\n          strange old hermit.\n\nLuke's gazes at the beautiful young princess for a few\nmoments.\n\n                    LUKE (CONT’D)\n          I wonder who she is. It sounds like\n          she's in trouble. I'd better play\n          back the whole thing.\n\nArtoo beeps something to Threepio.\n\n                    THREEPIO\n          He says the restraining bolt has\n          short circuited his recording\n          system. He suggests that if you\n          remove the bolt, he might be able\n          to play back the entire recording.\n\nLuke looks longingly at the lovely, little princess and\nhasn't really heard what Threepio has been saying.\n\n                    LUKE\n          H'm? Oh, yeah, well, I guess you're\n          too small to run away on me if I\n          take this off! Okay.\n\nLuke takes a wedged bar and pops the restraining bolt off\nArtoo's side.\n\n                    LUKE (CONT’D)\n          There you go.\n\nThe princess immediately disappears...\n\n                    LUKE (CONT’D)\n          Well, wait a minute. Where'd she\n          go? Bring her back! Play back the\n          entire message.\n\nArtoo beeps an innocent reply as Threepio sits up in\nembarrassment.\n\n                    THREEPIO\n          What message? The one you're\n          carrying inside your rusty innards!\n\nA women's voice calls out from another room.\n\n                    AUNT BERU\n          Luke? Luke! Come to dinner!\n\nLuke stands up and shakes his head at the malfunctioning\nrobot.\n\n                     LUKE\n          All right, I'll be right there,\n          Aunt Beru.\n\n                    THREEPIO\n          I'm sorry, sir, but he appears to\n          have picked up a slight flutter.\n\nLuke tosses Artoo's restraining bolt on the workbench and\nhurries out of the room.\n\n                    LUKE\n          Well, see what you can do with him.\n          I'll be right back.\n\n                    THREEPIO\n              (to Artoo)\n          Just you reconsider playing that\n          message for him.\n\nArtoo beeps in response.\n\n                         THREEPIO (CONT’D)\n               No, I don't think he likes you at\n               all.\n\n     Artoo beeps.\n\n                         THREEPIO (CONT’D)\n               No, I don't like you either.\n\n31",

Two more\n      troops appear on another overhang, also firing. A trooper is\n      hit, and grabs at his chest.\n\n      Another trooper standing on the bridge overhang is hit by\n      Luke's laserfire, and plummets down the shaft.

Luke tosses the rope across the\n      gorge and it wraps itself around an outcropping of pipes. He\n      tugs on the rope to make sure it is secure, then grabs the\n      princess in his arms.

    "ANAKIN is standing in the living room. He is in a meditative state. It is quiet. We hear DISTANT FOOTSTEPS in the corridor outside the apartment. Suddenly ANAKIN'S eyes pop open. His eyes dart around the room. He reaches for his lightsaber, then smiles and puts it back in his belt.\n\nThe door to the apartment slides open, and OBI-WAN enters.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tCaptain Typho has more than enough\n\t\t\tmen downstairs. No assassin will\n\t\t\ttry that way. Any activity up\n\t\t\there?\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tQuiet as a tomb. I don't like\n\t\t\tjust waiting here for something to\n\t\t\thappen to her.\n\nOBI-WAN checks a palm-sized view scanner he has pulled out of his utility belt. It shows a shot of ARTOO by the door, but no sign of PADME on the bed.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tWhat's going on?\n\nANAKIN shrugs.\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tShe covered that camera. I don't\n\t\t\tthink she liked me watching her.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tWhat is she thinking?\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tShe programmed Artoo to warn us if\n\t\t\tthere's an intruder.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tIt's not an intruder I'm worried\n\t\t\tabout. There are many other ways\n\t\t\tto kill a Senator.\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tI know, but we also want to catch\n\t\t\tthis assassin. Don't we, Master?\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tYou're using her as bait??\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tIt was her idea... No harm will\n\t\t\tcome to her.

    "As PADME sleeps, a PROBE DROID approaches outside her window. It sends out several small arms that attach to the window, creating sparks that shut down the security system. Then a large arm cuts a small hole in the glass. A FAINT SOUND is heard as the small section of glass is removed from the window.\n\nARTOO wakes up, and his lights go on. The PROBE DROID freezes. ARTOO looks around, makes a PLAINTIVE LITTLE SOUND, then shuts down again. The PROBE DROID attaches a little tube to the window.

You've made a\n\t\t\tcommitment to the Jedi order... a\n\t\t\tcommitment not easily broken...\n\t\t\tand don't forget she's a\n\t\t\tpolitician. They're not to be\n\t\t\ttrusted.\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN \n\t\t\tShe's not like the others in the\n\t\t\tSenate, Master.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tIt's been my experience that\n\t\t\tSenators are only focused on\n\t\t\tpleasing those who fund their\n\t\t\tcampaigns... and they are more\n\t\t\tthan willing to forget the\n\t\t\tniceties of democracy to get those\n\t\t\tfunds.\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tNot another lecture, Master. Not\n\t\t\ton the economics of politics....\n\t\t\tIt's too early in the morning... and\n\t\t\tbesides, you're generalising.

My\n\t\t\tinstincts are very positive\n\t\t\tabout...\n\nANAKIN looks stunned. He looks sharply at OBI-WAN\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tI sense it, too.",
    "ARTOO sounds an alarm and shines a light on the bed. THE KOUHUNS are inches from PADME'S face. Their mouths are open, and wicked stinger tongues flick out.\n\n\nOBI-WAN and ANAKIN burst into the room. The KOUHUNS stand on their hind legs and hiss as PADME wakes up. ANAKIN throws himself in front of her, whacking in half the deadly creatures with his lightsaber.\n\nOBI-WAN sees the DROID outside the window and raqces straight at it, crashing through the blinds as he goes through the window.",
    "OBI-WAN flies through the glass window and flings himself at the PROBE DROID, grabbing onto the deadly machine before it can flee. The PROBE DROID sinks under the weight of OBI-WAN but manages to stay afloat and fly away, with the Jedi hanging on for dear life, a hundred stories above the city.",
    "ANAKIN and PADME stare at the sight of OBI-WAN being carried off by the DROID. ANAKIN turns to her. She pulls her nightdress around her shoulders.\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tStay here!\n\nCAPTAIN TYPHO, with TWO GUARDS and DORME, enter the room as Anakin dashes out.",
    "The PROBE DROID sends several protective electrical shocks across its surface, causing OBI-WAN to almost lose his grip. As they dart in and out of the speeder traffic, OBI-WAN disconnects a wire on the back of the DROID. Its power shuts off! OBI-WAN and the DROID drop like rocks. OBI-WAN realises the error of his ways and quickly puts the wire back. The DROID'S systems light up again and it takes off.",
    "ANAKIN charges out of the building and runs to a line of parked speeders. He vaults into an open one and takes off, gunning it fast toward the lines of speeder traffic high above.",
    "The DROID bumps against a wall, hoping to knock the Jedi loose. It moves behind a speeder afterburner to scorch him. It takesthe JEDI wildly between buildings and finally skims across a rooftop as OBI-WAN is forced to lift his legs, tenaciously hanging onto the DROID. The DROID heads for a dirty, beat-up speeder hidden in an alcove of a building about twenty stories up. When the pilot of the speeder, a scruffy bounty hunter called ZAM WESELL, sees the DROID approach with OBI-WAN hanging on, she pulls a long rifle out of the speeder and starts to fire at the JEDI. EXPLOSIONS burst all around OBI-WAN.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tI have a bad feeling about this.\n\nFINALLY, the DROID suffers a direct hit and blows up. OBI-WAN falls fifty stories, until a speeder drops down next to him, and he manages to grab onto the back end of the speeder and haul himself toward the cockpit. The JEDI struggles to climb into the passenger seat of the open speeder and sit down next to the driver, ANAKIN.\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tThat was wacky! I almost lost you\n\t\t\tin the traffic.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tWhat took you so long?\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tOh, you know, Master, I couldn't\n\t\t\tfind a speeder I really liked,\n\t\t\twith an open cockpit... and with\n\t\t\tthe right speed capabilities...\n\t\t\tand then you know I had to get a\n\t\t\treally gonzo color...\n\nThey zoom upward in hot pursuit of ZAM asshe fires out the open window at them with her laser pistol.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tIf you'd spend as much time\n\t\t\tworking on your saber skills as\n\t\t\tyou do on your wit, young Padawan,\n\t\t\tyou would rival Master Yoda as a\n\t\t\tswordsman.\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tI thought I already did.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tOnly in your mind, my very young\n\t\t\tapprentice. Careful!! Hey, easy!!\n\nAs this conversation is going on, ANAKIN deftly moves in and out of the oncoming traffic, across lanes, between buildings, and miraculously through a construction site. ZAM WESELL continues firing at them.\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tSorry, I forgot you don't like\n\t\t\tflying, Master.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tI don't mind flying... but\n\t\t\twhat you're doing is suicide!\n\nThey barely miss a commuter train\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tMaster, you know I've been flying\n\t\t\tsince before I could walk. I'm very\n\t\t\tgood at this.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tJust slow down!\n\nZAM WESSEL and the JEDI race through a line of cross-traffic made up of giant trucks. The speeders bank sideways as they slide around right-angle turns between buildings. ZAM races into a tram tunnel.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\t\tWait! Don't go in there!\n\nANAKIN zooms into the tunnel after ZAM. They see a tram coming at them. They brake, turn around, and race out, barely ahead of the charging commuter transport.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\t\tYou know I don't like it when you\n\t\t\tdo that!\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tSorry, Master. Don't worry, this\n\t\t\tguy's gonna kill himself any\n\t\t\tminute now!\n\nZAM WESSEL turns into oncoming traffic, deliberately trying to throw the JEDI off. Oncoming speeders swerve, trying to avoid ZAM and the JEDI. ZAM does a quick, tight loop-over and ends up behind the JEDI. She is now in a much better position to fire at them with her laser pistol. To avoid being hit by the laser bolts, ANAKIN slams on the brakes and moves alongside ZAM. She now fires point-blank at OBI-WAN.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tWhat are you doing? He's gonna\n\t\t\tblast me!\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tRight - this isn't working.\n\nANAKIN slides underneath Zam's speeder. They race along in traffic, one speeder right on top of the other. The BOUNTY HUNTER skims over the rooftops, causing ANAKIN to drop behind. ANAKIN goes through his gears, zooming around traffic. They race at high speed across a wide, flat surface of the city planet. A large spacecraft almost collides with them as it attempts to land. They round a corner and clip a flag, which gets caught on one of the front air scoops.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tThat was too close!\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tClear that!\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tWhat??\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tClear the flag! We're losing\n\t\t\tpower! Hurry!\n\nOBI-WAN leans out of the speeder, then crawls out onto the front engine, pulling the flag free of the scoop. The speeder lurches forward with a surge of power.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tWhooooaaa! Don't do that! I\n\t\t\tdon't  like it when you do that!\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tSo sorry, Master.\n\nThey chase the BOUNTY HUNTER through a power refinery.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tIt's dangerous near those power\n\t\t\tcouplings! Slow down! Don't go\n\t\t\tthrough there!\n\nHuge electrical bolts shoot between the buildings as the speeders pass.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\t\tYiiii, what are you doing?\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tSorry, Master!\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\t\t(sarcastically)\n\t\t\tOh, that was good...\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tThat was crazy!!!\n\nZAM slides around a corner sideways, blocking an alley, firing point-blank as ANAKIN approaches.\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\t\tAhh, damn.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tStop!!\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tNo, we can make it.\n\nANAKIN barely misses the BOUNTY HUNTER'S speeder as he dives under it, and through a small gap in the building hitting several pipes and going wildly out of control. ANAKIN struggles to regain control of the speeder, narrowly missing a crane, barely clipping a pair of giant struts. A giant gasball shoots up, causing ANAKIN to spin and bump a building, stalling the speeder.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tI'm crazy... I'm crazy... I'm\n\t\t\tcrazy.\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tBut it worked... we made it.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\t\t(angrily)\n\t\t\tIt didn't work... we've stalled!\n\t\t\tAnd you almost got us killed!\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tI think we're still alive.\n\nANAKIN works to get the speeder started. It quickly races to life.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\t\t(very angrily)\n\t\t\tIt was stupid!\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\t\t(sheepishly)\n\t\t\tI could have made it...\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\t\t(furious)\n\t\t\tBut you didn't!!! And now we've\n\t\t\tlost him.\n\nSuddenly, there is an ambush. Laser bolts fire everywhere. EXPLOSIONS surround them. They look up to see ZAM WESSEL take off.\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tNo we didn�t...\n\nOut of a cloud of smoke and ball of flames the JEDI tear after ZAM. They are smoking. OBI-WAN slaps out the small fire on the dashboard. ZAM goes up and down, through cross-traffic. There is a near miss as a speeder almost hits them. ZAM turns down and left between two buildings. ANAKIN pulls up and to the right\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tWhere are you going?! He went\n\t\t\tdown there, the other way.\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tThis is a shortcut... I think.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tWhat do you mean, �You think?�\n\t\t\tWhat kind of shortcut?! He went\n\t\t\tcompletely the other way! You�ve\n\t\t\tlost him!\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tMaster, if we keep this chase\n\t\t\tgoing, that creep�s gonna end up\n\t\t\tdeep fried. Personally, I�d very\n\t\t\tmuch like to find out who in the\n\t\t\thell he is and who he�s working\n\t\t\tfor...\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\t\t(sarcastic)\n\t\t\tOh, so that�s why we�re going in\n\t\t\tthe wrong direction.\n\nANAKIN turns up a side street, zooming up several small passageways, then stops, hovering about fifty stories up.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\t\tWell, you lost him.\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tI�m deeply sorry, Master.\n\nANAKIN looks around front and back. He spots something. He seems to \nstart counting to himself as he watches something below approach.\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\t\tExcuse me for a moment.\n\nANAKIN jumps out of the speeder. OBI-WAN looks down and sees Zam�s speeder about five stories below them cruising past. ANAKIN miraculously lands on top of the Bounty Hunter�s speeder. The speeder wobbles under the impact. ZAM looks up and realises what has happened.\n\nZAM takes off, and ANAKIN slides to the back strut and almost slips off, but manages to hang on. ANAKIN works his way back to the speeder�s cockpit, just as ZAM stops suddenly, and ANAKIN flies forward to the left front fork. ZAM shoots at him with a laser pistol. There is a BLAST near ANAKIN'S hand, which breaks off a piece of the speeder. ANAKIN slides to the right fork of the speeder, where ZAM can�t reach him. He scrambles to the top, holding onto an air scoop.\n\nOBI-WAN has jumped into the driver�s seat of his speeder and is deftly gaining on the rogue speeder. The two speeders dive through oncoming traffic and then through cross traffic. Finally, ANAKIN is able to get hold of his lightsaber and starts to cut his way through the roof of the speeder. ZAM takes out her laser pistol and starts firing at the helpless JEDI, knocking the sword out of his hand. OBI-WAN races under the speeder and catches the Jedi weapon in the passenger�s seat.\n\nANAKIN sticks his hand into the cockpit and, using the Force, pulls the gun out of ZAM�S hand. She grabs the Jedi�s hand, and they struggle for the weapon. It goes off, blowing a hole in the floor of the speeder. The speeder careens wildly out of control. ZAM struggles to pull the speeder out of it�s nose dive. OBI-WAN gets slowed down by traffic and loses sight of the Bounty Hunter�s speeder.\n\nJust as the dragster is about to nose dive into the ground, ZAM pulls it out, and it slides hard on the pavement in a shower of sparks. ANAKIN goes flying into the street.",
    "ZAM exits the crashed speeder and runs. ANAKIN picks himself up off the pavement and runs down the very crowded street.\n\nIt's the seedy underbelly of the city. Broken sidewalks, garish lights reflected on the filthy puddles. It's pretty crowded with various ALIEN LOW-LIFES, PANHANDLING DROIDS, and the occasional group of UPPERCLASS SLUMMERS.\n\nANAKIN barges into several of them as he chases after the fleeing ZAM. He loses the Bounty Hunter in the crowd, them sees him again. The young Jedi is having a very difficult time getting through the crowd.\n\nAhead, ZAM turns in through a door and disappears.\n\nA nightclub sighs is flashing over the door. ANAKIN is just about to follow ZAM when there is a sudden swirl of litter from downthrusters. PEOPLE start moving out of the way, and the open speeder lands in the street beside him. OBI-WAN gets out and walks over, holding out ANAKIN'S lightsaber.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tAnakin!\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tShe went into that club, Master.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tPatience.\n\nOBI-WAN hands ANAKIN the lightsaber.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\t \t(continuing)\n\t\t\tHere. Next time try not to lose it.\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tSorry, Master.\n\nANAKIN reaches for the lightsaber, but OBI-WAN holds it back.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tA Jedi's saber is his most\n\t\t\tprecious possession.\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tYes, Master.\n\nHe reaches for the lightsaber, OBI-WAN pulls it back.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tHe must keep it with him at all\n\t\t\ttimes.\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tI know, Master.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tThis weapon is your life!\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tI've heard this lesson before...\n\nOBI-WAN finally holds out the lightsaber and ANAKIN grabs it.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tBut, you haven't learned anything,\n\t\t\tAnakin.\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tI try, Master.",
    "OBI-WAN and ANAKIN enter the nightclub bar, and everyone stares at them\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tWhy do I think you are going to be\n\t\t\tthe death of me?!\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tDon't say that Master...

ANAKIN blinks in surprise, then moves into the room, where ALIEN FACES look back at him with hostility, suspicion, and invitation as he moves among the tables. OBI-WAN arrives at the bar. He signals the BARMAN.\n\nCLOSE - Somewhere in the room a HAND moves to a pistol in its holster and unsnaps the safety catch. At the bar, a glass is placed in from of OBI-WAN. A drink is poured. He lifts the glass.\n\n\t\t\t\tELAN SLEAZEBAGGANO\n\t\t\tWanna buy some death sticks?\n\nOBI-WAN looks at him.

OBI-WAN lifts the drink and tosses it back.\n\nCLOSE. The gun is drawn from its holster and held down out of sight. The BOUNTY HUNTER starts to move toward the bar.\n\nANAKIN checks out ALIEN FACES. OBI-WAN signals for another drink. The gun moves toward his unsuspecting back.\n\nThe drink is poured. OBI-WAN reaches for it. The gun is raised to aim directly at his back, and suddenly OBI-WAN turns fast. His lightsaber flashes. There is a shrill SCREAM and ZAM'S ARM hits the floor. The gun drops from its twitching fingers. Blood spreads.\n\nThe room is silent. ALIENS rise menacingly from their seats, and ANAKIN is suddenly at OBI-WAN's side, his lightsaber glowing.\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tEasy... Official business. Go\n\t\t\tback to your drinks.\n\nSlowly, the ALIENS sit. Conversation resumes. Onstage, THE PERFORMERS pick up their routine. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN lift ZAM and carry her out.",
    "OBI-WAN and ANAKIN carry ZAM into the alley and lower her to the ground. OBI-WAN attends to her wounded shoulder. She stares up hatefully at ANAKIN.

PADME is in the center.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tI was beginning to wonder if you\n\t\t\thad gotten my message.\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tI retransmitted it as you\n\t\t\trequested, Master.

One is a REEK (bull-like), one is a NEXU (lion-like), and one is an ACKLAY (a kind of dino-lobster). They are driven in by PICADORS carrying long spears and riding ORRAYS. The PICADORS poke the MONSTERS toward the center, then retire to the perimeter.\n\nThe MONSTERS toss their heads, looking around, ROARING or SCREECHING. Then they catch sight of the THREE CAPTIVES and start moving toward them.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tTake the one the left. I'll\n\t\t\ttake the one on the right.\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tWhat about Padme?\n\nPADME has turned around and is pulling herself up by the chain to the top of the post. Within a moment, she is standing on top of it, trying to pull the chain free.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tIt looks like she's already on top\n\t\t\tof things.\n\nThe REEK charges ANAKIN. He jumps up, and the beast hits the post hard. ANAKIN lands onto its back, wrapping part of his chain around its horn. The REEK backs off, shaking its head angrily, which tears the chain from the post\n\nOBI-WAN ducks around the post as the ACKLAY charges. It knocks the post flat, sending OBI-WAN sprawling. The ACKLAY crunches the post between its claws, freeing the chain. OBI-WAN leaps up and runs towards ONE of the PICADORS. The ACKLAY taks off after him.\n\nThe NEXU arrives at PADME'S post and rears on its hind legs. One top, PADME struggles to tear the chain free. The NEXU ROARS, displaying wicked, dripping fangs.\n\nIn the archducal box, NUTE GUNRAY beams and rubs his hands.\n\nIn the arena, OBI-WAN runs at the PICADOR. The ORRAY rears up. OBI-WAN grabs the PICADOR'S long spear and pole vaults over him. The chasing ACKLAY smashes into the ORRAY. It goes down. The PICADOR tumbles onto the sand, where he is grabbed by the ACKLAY and crunched.\n\nANAKIN's REEK starts to buck. It charges around the arena with ANAKIN hanging on for dear life. He whirls the free length of chain around his head and casts it into the REEK's mouth. Its jaws clamp hard on the chain. ANAKIN yanks hard on the chain, turning the REEK, beginning to ride it.\n\nThe NEXU's claws dig deep into the post. The cat-like creature reaches the top of the post and takes a swipe at PADME. She turns and the claw barely catches her shirt ripping it off, leaving superficial claw marks across her back. She hits the creature with her chain and it backs off down the pole. Then, PADME jumps off the post into the air. She swings around on the chain and whacks the beast hard on the head with both her feet. It tumbles back onto the sand.\n\nIn the archducal box:\n\n\t\t\t\tNUTE GUNRAY\n\t\t\tFoul!! She can't do that... shoot\n\t\t\ther or something!\n\nIn the arena, OBI-WAN runs out from behind the fallen ORRAY and throws the spear at the ACKLAY, hitting it in the neck. It lets out a terrible SCREECH and turns on him. The NEXU springs up and makes to leap up at PADME again. She finally manages to work the chain loose. ANAKIN comes charging up on the REEK.\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tYou okay?\n\n\t\t\t\tPADME\n\t\t\t\t(nods, gasping)\n\t\t\tSure! Well, sort of.\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tJump!!!\n\nThe NEXU springs. PADME leaps from the top of the post to land on the REEK in front of ANAKIN. He hauls her upright. The REEK charges away, around the arena. The NEXU bounds after it. The REEK passes the wounded ACKLAY. The NEXU smells the blood and turns aside to attack the ACKLAY. The TWO MONSTERS fight. The crowd GROANS and BOOS.\n\nIn the archducal box, NUTE GUNRAY turns angrily to COUNT DOOKU.\n\n\t\t\t\tNUTE GUNRAY\n\t\t\tThis isn't how it's supposed to\n\t\t\tbe!

JANGO FETT and MACE WINDU jump into the arena, where they fight. BOBA FETT wacthes his Dad and the Jedi Master fight. The battle beginss. GEONOSIANS fly away everywhere. DROIDS fire at JEDI, who deflect the bolts and cult down the DROIDS. The GEONOSIAN TROOPS fire ray guns that are more difficult for the JEDI to deflect.\n\nThe REEK and the NEXU are spooked by the battle. The REEK bucks the riders off its back and stampedes around the arena, trampling DROIDS and JEDI that have moved into its path. PADME picks up a discarded pistol and joins the fight. SEVERAL JEDI run to the center of the arena and toss lightsabers to OBI-WAN and ANAKIN.\n\nAmong the crowd, JEDI cut down swaths of GEONOSIANS and DROIDS. On the sand, JEDI fight, attacking DROIDS.

ANAKIN raises his lightsaber. At the last moment, COUNT DOOKU thrusts out an arm, and ANAKIN is lifted up, hurled across the room, and slammed into the opposite wall. He slumps to the foot of the wall, semi-conscious. COUNT DOOKU moves toward OBI-WAN\n\n\t\t\t\tCOUNT DOOKU\n\t\t\tKenobi, isn't it? As you can see,\n\t\t\tmy Jedi powers are far beyond\n\t\t\tyours.

He and OBI-WAN start to circle each other.\n\n\t\t\t\tCOUNT DOOKU\n\t\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\t\tI have spent the last ten years\n\t\t\tlearning to use the power of the\n\t\t\tDark Side. It gives me infinitely\n\t\t\tgreater power.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tYou will have to prove it.\n\nOBI-WAN comes in fast, swinging at COUNT DOOKU'S head. DOOKU parries the cut easily. As they fight, it quickly becomes clear that DOOKU is the complete swordsman - elegant, graceful, classical - a master of the old style.\n\n\t\t\t\tCOUNT DOOKU\n\t\t\tGrand Master Kenobi, you\n\t\t\tdisappoint me. Yoda holds you in\n\t\t\tsuch high esteem.\n\nCOUNT DOOKU parried another cut.\n\n\t\t\t\tCOUNT DOOKU\n\t\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\t\tSurely you can do better...?\n\t\t\t\t(parries)\n\t\t\tNo, I'm surprised.

OBI-WAN steps back quickly, panting for breath.\n\n\t\t\t\tCOUNT DOOKU\n\t\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\t\tcome, come, Master Kenobi. Put me\n\t\t\tout of my misery.\n\nOBI-WAN takes a deep breath, gets a fresh grip on his lightsaber and comes in again. For a moment, he drives COUNT DOOKU back. Then Dooku's superior skill begins to tell again, and he forces OBI-WAN to retreat.\n\nCOUNT DOOKU increases the tempo of his attack. OBI-WAN is pushed to the limit to defend himself. DOOKU presses. His lightsaber flashes.\n\nOBI-WAN is wounded in the shoulder, then the thigh. He stumbles back against the wall, trips, and falls. His lightsaber goes skittering across the floor.\n\nCOUNT DOOKU raises his lightsaber. OBI-WAN looks up helplessly. Dooku's lightsaber flashes down and CLASHES against - Anakin's lightsaber! COUNT DOOKU and ANAKIN stare eyeball to eyeball.\n\n\t\t\t\tCOUNT DOOKU\n\t\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\t\tThat's brave of you, boy - but\n\t\t\tfoolish. I would have thought\n\t\t\tyou'd have learnt your lesson.\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tI'm a slow learner.\n\nAnd ANAKIN charges at COUNT DOOKU. The force of his attack catches the Count slightly off balance. Anakin's lightsaber flashes. COUNT DOOKU draws back, putting a hand to his arm. He takes the hand away and looks at the smear of blood whee Anakin has nicked him.\n\n\t\t\t\tCOUNT DOOKU\n\t\t\tYou have unusual powers, young\n\t\t\tPadawan. But not enought to save\n\t\t\tyou this time.\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tDon't bet on it!\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tAnakin!\n\nOBI-WAN uses the Force to catch his lightsaber and he tosses it to ANAKIN. With TWO LIGHTSABERS, ANAKIN attacks. COUNT DOOKU parries and ripostes. It is no contest. ANAKIN is driven back against the wall. He loses one lightsaber. Finally COUNT DOOKU, in one flashing move, sends Anakin's arm, cut at the elbow, flying still gripping his lightsaber. ANAKIN drops to the ground in agony. COUNT DOOKU draws himself up to deliver the coup de grace.\n\nSuddenly, the great doors slide open. The DROIDS turn fast, raising their weapons. Through the thick smoke, emerges the heroic figure of YODA. He stops on the smoke-filled threashold, FOUR DROIDS lined up on either side of him, guns pointed.\n\nBefore the DROIDS can get off a shot, YODA raises his hand, and the DROIDS are flung against the far walls and crash to the floor in heaps of smoking metal.\n\nSilence. COUNT DOOKU steps away from ANAKIN to face the Jedi Grand Master. His lightsaber whirls in a formal salute.\n\n\t\t\t\tCOUNT DOOKU\n\t\t\tMaster Yoda. At last we shall\n\t\t\tknow who is the most powerful.\n\nYODA draws a miniature lightsaber out of his cane. He salutes formally.\n\n\t\t\t\tYODA\n\t\t\tCount Dooku. No interest in\n\t\t\tcontests, do I have.\n\nCOUNT DOOKU charges across the space at YODA. He rains down blows upon the tiny figure. YODA doesn't budge an inch. For the first part of the contest, he parries every cut and thrust that Dooku aims. Nothing the great swordsman tries gets through. His energy drains. His strokes become feebler, slower.\n\nYODA attacks! He flies forward. COUNT DOOKU is forced to retreat. Wprds are insufficient to describe the range and skill of Yoda's speed and swordplay. His lightsaber his a humming blur of light.\n\nCount Dooku's lightsaber is sent cartwheeling from his hand. He staggers back, gasping and spent, against the control panel. YODA jumps onto DOOKU'S shoulders, and is about to drive the lightsaber into the top of the Count's head.\n\n\t\t\t\tYODA\n\t\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\t\tThe end for you, Count, this is.\n\n\t\t\t\tCOUNT DOOKU\n\t\t\t...Not yet...\n\nCOUNT DOOKU raises his arms and knocks YODA off his shoulders and then, with all his might, he uses the Force to pull on one of the cranes in the hanger. It comes crashing down on OBI-WAN and ANAKIN. But in the blink of and eye, YODA is under the crane, holding it up, using the Force. YODA closes his eyes and concentrates.\n\nANAKIN is unconscious, and OBI0WAN tries toget out from under the crane. The fallen crane trembles and starts to life. Behind it, the sound of the Sail Ship's engines are heard starting up.\n\nYODA concentrates harder. Slowly, the crane rises. The SOUND OF THE ENGINES increases. YODA exerts every scrap of his powers. The crane lifts clear of ANAKIN and is thrown to the ground. DOOKU'S Sail Ship takes off. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN struggle to the exhausted YODA, but it's too late. The Sail Ship rises into the air and flies away. PADM� and a CLONE CAPTAIN with about TEN TROOPERS appear in the doorway.\n\n\t\t\t\tPADM�\n\t\t\tAnakin!\n\nPADM� runs too him and throws her arms around him. ANAKIN is barely able to stand up. The CLONE CAPTAIN marches up to YODA, stops, and salutes smartly.\n\n\t\t\t\tCLONE CAPTAIN\n\t\t\tResistance is at an end, General.\n\t\t\tWhat are your orders ?\n\nYODA looks at him and sighs.",

These droids are all over me like a rash. \n\nIn one incredible move, ANAKIN swings in behind the DROID TRI-FIGHTERS, blowing them away one by one until there is only one left. ARTOO CHIRPS. \n\nARTOO lets out a HOWL as ANAKIN accelerates past the last DROID TRI-FIGHTER, slams on his brakes, flips the Fighter around, and BLASTS the Fighter from the front. ARTOO BEEPS frantically as they fly through the debris of the destroyed ships. ANAKIN looks behind him. \n\nANAKIN: How many back there. Artoo? (Artoo beeps) Three . . . (continuing) Four . . . that's not good. \n\nOBI-WAN: Anakin, you have four on your tail. \n\nANAKIN: I know. I know! \n\nOBI-WAN: Four more closing from your left. \n\nANAKIN: I know.

Obi-Wan, do you copy? I'm going to pull them through the needle . . . \n\nOBI-WAN: Too dangerous. First Jedi rule: \"Survive.\" \n\nANAKIN: Sorry, no choice. Come down here and thin them out a little. \n\nOBI-WAN drops in behind the DROID VULTURE FIGHTERS chasing Anakin. ARFOUR BEEPS to OBI-WAN. \n\nOBI-WAN: Just keep me steady . . . hold on ... not yet. . . now break left. \n\nOBI-WAN fires as he swings across the back of the VULTURE DROIDS, BLASTING four of them away. ANAKIN heads for a trench along the surface of one of the Trade Federation Battleships. He flies into the trench, which ends in a conning tower with a small slit between two main struts. \n\nOBI-WAN: (continuing) You'll never get through there, Anakin. It's too tight. \n\nARTOO BEEPS nervously. \n\nANAKIN: Easy, Artoo . . . we've done this before. \n\nOBI-WAN: Use the Force, think yourself through, the ship will follow. \n\nARTOO SQUEALS in a panic. On the view screen Artoo's squeal reads out, \"WE'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE IT.\" \n\nANAKIN: Wrong thought, Artoo. \n\nANAKIN slips through the narrow gap. The trailing VULTURE DROID FIGHTERS CRASH. \n\nANAKIN: (continuing) I'm through. \n\nOBI-WAN continues to fire on the VULTURE DROID FIGHTERS, driving them into the EXPLOSION. \nA CLONE fighter is hit and explodes, spewing debris. The CLONE PILOT spins off into space. \nFinally, OBI-WAN peels off and swings around, pulling up alongside ANAKIN. CLONE FIGHT SQUAD SEVEN battles the DROIDS. \n\nODD BALL: There are too many of them. \n\nCLONE PILOT 2: I'm on your wing. Break left. Break left. They're all over me. Get them off my . . . \n\nANAKIN: I'm going to go help them out! \n\nOBI-WAN: No, no! They are doing their job so we can do ours. Head for the Command Ship! \n\nAnother CLONE fighter is hit, bursts into flames, and spins off into space. A VULTURE DROID FIGHTER raises its head to locate its target and fires missiles at them. \n\nANAKIN: Missiles! Pull up! \n\nANAKIN and OBI-WAN break right and left, and the missiles follow them. ANAKIN does a barrel roll spin, causing the missiles following him to collide and EXPLODE. Two missiles continue to chase OBI-WAN. He banks sharply to the right, then to the left, causing one of the missiles to overshoot. \n\nOBI-WAN: They overshot us . . . \n\nThe second missile streaks next to Obi-Wan�s Fighter and EXPLODES. Obi-Wan's ship rocks, and R-4, SCREAMS as the Starfighter rips through the explosion. Debris flies all around them. \n\nANAKIN: They're coming around! \n\nOBI-WAN: All right, Arfour. No, no. Nothing too fancy. \n\nANAKIN: Surge all power units. Artoo! Stand by the reverse thrusters. \n\nANAKIN spins his starfighter. The missiles spin and collide. \n\nANAKIN: We got 'em. Artoo! \n\nTwo missiles continue to track Obi-Wan. \n\nOBI-WAN: Flying is for droids. \n\nSuddenly, OBI-WAN shudders, and his ship starts to plummet toward the surface of the Trade Federation Cruiser. The trailing missiles fly into what looks like debris, and detonate. Five silver balls fly out of the debris and attach themselves to the ship. The balls pop open, revealing SMALL BUZZDROIDS that begin to crawl across the surface like spiders. \n\nOBI-WAN: (continuing) I'm hit! Anakin? \n\nANAKIN: I see them . . . Buzz Droids. \n\nThe BUZZ DROIDS crawl across Obi-Wan's ship and start to tear it apart. SPARKS ERUPT where the BUZZ DROIDS break into the wiring. One of the BUZZ DROIDS goes after ARFOUR. \n\nOBI-WAN: Arfour, be careful. You have one . . . \n\nARFOUR's head gets ripped off and flies away. \n\nOBI-WAN: Oh dear. They're shutting down all the controls. \n\nANAKIN: Move to the right so I can get a clear shot at them. \n\nOBI-WAN: The mission. Get to the Command Ship. Get the Chancellor! I'm running out of tricks here. \n\nANAKIN moves into position just off Obi-Wan's left side and angles his ship so his guns are pointing at the DROIDS crawling over Obi-Wan�s Starfighter. ANAKIN fires and vaporizes the TWO BUZZ DROIDS, along with the left wing of Obi-Wan's ship. \n\nOBI-WAN: (continuing) In the name of ... \n\nANAKIN: Steady . . . steady . . . \n\nOBI-WAN: Anakin, hold your fire . . . hold your fire. You're not helping here. \n\nANAKIN: I agree, bad idea. Swing right . . . ease over . . . steady . . . \n\nOBI-WAN: Wait . . . wait . . . I can't see a thing! My cockpit's fogging. They're all over me, Anakin. \n\nANAKIN: Move to the right. \n\nOBI-WAN: Hold on, Anakin. You're going to get us both killed! Get out of here. There's nothing more you can do. \n\nANAKIN: I'm not leaving without you, Master. \n\nANAKIN moves his ship next to OBI-WAN's and tries to physically knock the BUZZ DROIDS off. There are five left. He manages to get one off, but badly dents OBI-WAN's ship in the process. One of the BUZZ DROIDS tears apiece off of the front of Obi-Wan's ship. Flames burst out, and more smoke billows out, obscuring the Jedi's view. \n\nANAKIN knocks off three of the BUZZ DROIDS and the fourth crawls out onto Anakin's ship and starts attacking ARTOO. ARTOO fights the BUZZ DROID. \n\nOBI-WAN: Blast it ... I can't see . . . my controls are gone. \n\nANAKIN: Get 'em, Artoo. Watch out! \n\nOBI-WAN: Artoo, hit the buzz droid's center eye. \n\nARTOO extends an arm and aims a stream of electricity at the swerving BUZZ DROID. The BUZZ DROID is hit squarely in the eye and falls off the ship. \n\nANAKIN: Yeah, you got him! \n\nOBI-WAN: Great, Artoo. \n\nANAKIN: Stay on my wing . . . the General's Command Ship is dead ahead. Easy . . . pull up ... Head for the hangar. \n\nOBI-WAN: Have you noticed the shields are still up? \n\nANAKIN: Oh?!? Sorry, Master. \n\nANAKIN streaks ahead of OBI-WAN's disintegrating Jedi Fighter and blasts the shield generator. It SPARKS and EXPLODES. \n\nOBI-WAN: Oh, I have a bad feeling about this. \n\n9",

A set of blast doors starts SLAMMING shut across the hangar opening, as material is sucked into space. \n\nANAKIN maneuvers around the oncoming junk and flies into the hangar just as the blast doors SLAM shut. \nOBI-WAN ignites his light saber and cuts his way out of the cockpit. He jumps dear just as his ship EXPLODES. BATTLE DROIDS rush at him from all directions. \n\nANAKIN jumps out of his ship and cuts his way through the BATTLE DROIDS to where OBI-WAN is fighting. ARTOO pops out of the ship and follows ANAKIN. \n\nOBI-WAN: Artoo, locate the Chancellor. \n\nANAKIN: Tap into the ship's computers. \n\nThey cut down the last of the droids and follow ARTOO over to a computer wall socket. The two JEDI fight off FOUR MORE DROIDS as ARTOO tries to find the Chancellor. Finally, a HOLOGRAM of the Trade Federation ship appears. \n\nOBI-WAN: The Chancellor's signal is coming from right there. The observation platform at the top of that spire. \n\nANAKIN: I sense Count Dooku . . . \n\nOBI-WAN: I sense a trap. \n\nANAKIN: Next move? \n\nOBI-WAN: Spring the trap. \n\nThe JEDI start to leave; ARTOO follows. The JEDI stop and turn to ARTOO. \n\nANAKIN: Artoo, go back. I need you to stay with the ship. \n\nOBI-WAN: Here, take this, and wait for orders. \n\nOBI-WAN tosses the comlink to ARTOO. \n\n10",

He walks to the front of the bridge and stands in front of the NEIMOIDIAN CAPTAIN. \n\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: What's the situation, Captain? \n\nCAPTAIN: TWO Jedi have landed in the main hangar bay. \n\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: Just as Count Dooku predicted. \n\n11",
    "ANAKIN and OBI-WAN head for the elevator. A door opens in the hallway and two of GENERAL GRIEVOUS's BODYGUARDS confront the JEDI. \n\nBODYGUARD I: General Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker. We've been waiting for you. \n\nOBI-WAN: We are here to relieve you of Chancellor Palpatine, not join him. \n\nAs a dozen more droids join the group, the JEDI ignite their lightsabers and stand back-to-back. \n\nOBI-WAN: Anakin. . . \n\nANAKIN: Ready. \n\nANAKIN and OBI-WAN use their lightsabers and cut a large circle in the floor. \n\n12",
    "The TWO JEDI cut their way down several floors into a large generator room. Huge EXPLOSIONS outside the ship have caused several large pipes overhead to break, and fluid is spewing everywhere. The Jedi get up and turn off their light sabers. ANAKIN dips his hand into the fluid and sniffs it. \n\nOBI-WAN: . . . fuel. The slightest charge from our sabers will send this ship into oblivion. That's why they've stopped shooting. \n\nANAKIN: Well then, we're safe for the time being. \n\nOBI-WAN: Your idea of safe is not the same as mine. \n\nThey run, EXPLOSIONS rattle the ship, and pipes continue to burst around them, spilling more fuel into the hallway. At the far end, SIX SUPER BATTLE DROIDS drop into the fuel. The SOUNDS OF SHIELD DOORS CLOSING AND LOCKING ECHO throughout the hallway. They pass several large power generators, which are topped with SPARKING excess power dischargers. \n\nANAKIN: They're sealing this section off. \n\nOBI-WAN: Six droids coming our way! \n\nThe last of the DOORS CAN BE HEARD CLOSING in the distance. \n\nANAKIN: Keep moving. There must be vents . . . This way. \n\nThey move along a wall. ANAKIN climbs up the side to a small vent. The fuel gets closer to the SPARKING dischargers. \n\nOBI-WAN: We'll never get through that. It's too small! \n\nThey move toward a second vent. OBI-WAN is swimming in the fuel as it reaches to within a couple yards of the ceiling. ANAKIN feels along the ceiling and finds another smaller vent. He closes his eyes and tries to sense an opening, then he moves on. OBI-WAN is forced into hand-to-hand combat with one of the SUPER BATTLE DROIDS. It pulls the Jedi under the fuel. Just before he is about to drown, OBI-WAN disables the SUPER BATTLE DROID by pushing him into an exhaust pipe. \n\nThe fuel is up to the Jedi's chins. ANAKIN finds a very, very small metal grate, then pounds on it until the tiny grate breaks loose. \n\nANAKIN: I found our escape vent. \n\nOBI-WAN: Anakin, this is no time for jokes. We're in serious trouble here. \n\nANAKIN: Only in your mind. My Master. Look, no structure. . . . \n\nANAKIN grabs the side of the tiny hole and gives it a big yank, ripping a large panel loose revealing a \"man-sized\" work shaft.

This side's pressurized. \n\nOBI-WAN: You still have much to learn, Anakin. \n\n16",
    "The SUPER BATTLE DROIDS climb up the vent shaft. SUPER BATTLE DROID R77 and SEVERAL OTHER DROIDS wait in the generator room as the fuel continues to rise toward the power discharger. \n\nSUPER BATTLE DROID R77: I have a bad feeling about this. \n\n17",

OBI-WAN and ANAKIN turn around. The elevator DOORS CAN BE HEARD OPENING AND CLOSING as COUNT DOOKU strides into the room. He is above the Jedi, standing on a balcony, with two SUPER BATTLE DROIDS. The Jedi turn to see him.

He's a Sith Lord. \n\nOBI-WAN: Chancellor Palpatine, Sith Lords are our specialty. \n\nOBI-WAN and ANAKIN throw off their cloaks and ignite their lightsabers. \n\nCOUNT DOOKU: Your swords, please, Master Jedi.

You'll have to do better. \n\nAs the battle proceeds, OBI-WAN and COUNT DOOKU are tired. ANAKIN is stronger as he becomes angry. ANAKIN continues to drive the attack on DOOKU. COUNT DOOKU throws OBI-WAN back using the Force. \nANAKIN and COUNT DOOKU move up the stairs. As they reach the upper landing of the General's Quarters, ANAKIN leaps over COUNT DOOKU. OBI-WAN reaches the top of the stairs, destroying TWO SUPER BATTLE DROIDS. COUNT DOOKU holds OBI-WAN in the air using the Force as he turns and kicks ANAKIN out of frame. OBI-WAN is choking. \nANAKIN hits the archway. \nDOOKU sends OBI-WAN flying. The Jedi tumbles to the lower level unconscious. COUNT DOOKU spins around again and, using the Force, causes a section of the balcony to drop onto OBI-WAN. ANAKIN spins and kicks COUNT DOOKU, sending him over the balcony. ANAKIN Jumps, following him down to the main floor. COUNT DOOKU and ANAKIN continue the fight. \n\nCOUNT DOOKU: (continuing) I sense great fear in you, Skywalker. You have hate, you have anger, but you don�t use them. \n\nAnakin regains his composure and attacks COUNT DOOKU as the Dark Lord continues his spin to meet him head on. Their fighting becomes even more intense. \nAnakin attacks COUNT DOOKU with a new ferociousness. \n\n39",
    "Anakin and Dooku continue their fight. It is intense! Finally, in one last energized charge, ANAKIN cuts off COUNT DOOKU's hands.

Kill him now! \n\nANAKIN: I shouldn't . . . \n\nPALPATINE: Do it!! \n\nANAKIN cuts off COUNT DOOKU's head. A huge EXPLOSION somewhere deep in the ship rattles everything. \n\nANAKIN: ... I couldn't stop myself. \n\nPALPATINE: You did well, Anakin. He was too dangerous to be kept alive. \n\nANAKIN drops COUNT DOOKU's lightsaber, moving to PALPATINE. \n\nANAKIN: Yes, but he was an unarmed prisoner. \n\nANAKIN raises his hands toward PALPATINE, who is strapped in the Admiral's Chair. The Chancellor's restraints pop loose. \n\nANAKIN: (continuing) I shouldn't have done that, Chancellor. It's not the Jedi way. \n\nPALPATINE stands up, rubbing his wrists. \n\nPALPATINE: It is only natural. He cut off your arm, and you wanted revenge. It wasn't the first time, Anakin. Remember what you told me about your mother and the Sand People. Now, we must leave before more security droids arrive. \n\nThe ship begins to list to one side. ANAKIN rushes over to OBI-WAN, lifts the control console from on top of him, and pulls him free. He kneels down and checks out his unconscious friend.

ANAKIN runs at the General from the opposing side. GENERAL GRIEVOUS turns and throws his electrified staff at the window. It breaks, causing chaos as everything that is not nailed down is sucked into space. GENERAL GRIEVOUS is the first one sucked out into space. He fires a cable from his arm that attaches to the ship. He swings in and lands firmly on the side of the ship. \nOBI-WAN, ANAKIN, and PALPATINE hold on for dear life. A blast shield closes around where the window used to be. \n\n63",

There is a great jolt, and the ship tilts forward. \n\nOBI-WAN: Well? \n\nANAKIN: Under the circumstances, I'd say the ability to pilot this thing is irrelevant. Strap yourselves in. \n\nOBI-WAN and PALPATINE strap themselves into chairs. ANAKIN struggles with the controls of the ship. The ship starts to glow, and pieces break off.

I'm going to shift a few degrees and see if I can slow us down. \n\nOBI-WAN: Careful . . . we're heating up-twelve thousand . . . thirteen thousand . . . \n\nANAKIN: What's our speed? \n\nOBI-WAN: Eight plus sixty-forty. Eight plus sixty-twenty. Eight plus sixty. Temp ten thousand, nine thousand . . . we're in the atmosphere . . . \n\nANAKIN points to one of the controls.

I have to report to the Council. Besides, someone needs to be the poster boy. \n\nANAKIN: Hold on, this whole operation was your idea. You planned it. You led the rescue operation. You have to be the one to take the bows this time. \n\nOBI-WAN: Sorry, old friend. Let us not forget that you rescued me from the Buzz Droids. And you killed Count Dooku. And you rescued the Chancellor, carrying me unconscious on your back, and you managed to land that bucket of bolts safely . . . \n\nANAKIN: All because of your training, Master. You deserve all those speeches of your greatness. \n\nOBI-WAN: . . . the endless speeches . . . Anakin, let's be fair. Today, you are the hero and you deserve your glorious day with the politicians. \n\nANAKIN: All right.

Are you all right? \n\nPALPATINE: Yes, thanks to your two Jedi Knights. They killed Count Dooku, but General Grievous has escaped once again. \n\nMACE WlNDU: General Grievous will run and hide as he always does. He is a coward. \n\nPALPATINE: That maybe true, but with Count Dooku dead, he is the leader of the Droid Army, and I assure you, the Senate will vote to continue the war as long as Grievous is alive. \n\nMACE WlNDU: Then the Jedi Council will make finding Grievous our highest priority. \n\nBAIL, ANAKIN, and the crowd walk away from the platform toward the Senate Building Grand Hallway. \n\nBAIL ORGANA: Skywalker, the Republic cannot praise you enough. \n\nANAKIN and BAIL ORGANA, walking in the hallway. \n\nANAKIN: Thank you, Senator Organa. The kidnapping was a bold move by the Separatists, but it was a mistake that Obi-Wan and I were able to take advantage of. \n\nARTOO and THREEPIO follow behind the crowd. \n\nC-3PO: It couldn't possibly be as bad as all that. \n\nARTOO beeps. \n\nC-3PO: (continuing) Well, there, I agree with you. In fact, I could do with a tune-up myself. \n\n70",
    "ANAKIN is at the back of the crowd of SENATORS, talking with BAIL ORGANA. R2-D2 and C-3PO scoot along ahead of them. \n\nBAIL ORGANA: The end of Count Dooku will surely bring an end to this war, and an end to the Chancellor's draconian security measures. \n\nANAKIN: I wish that were so, but the fighting is going to continue until General Grievous is spare parts . . . The Chancellor is very clear about that. \n\nBehind a row of large columns, a SHADOWY FIGURE follows the JEDI and the SENATOR. ANAKIN senses the figure. \n\nBAIL ORGANA: I'll do everything I can with the Senate. \n\nANAKIN: Excuse me. \n\nBAIL ORGANA: Certainly. \n\nANAKIN stops, and BAIL goes off after PALPATINE and the others. ANAKIN goes behind one of the giant columns to meet up with the SHADOWY FIGURE, who is revealed to be SENATOR PADME AMDALA. They embrace and kiss. \n\nPADME: Oh, Anakin! Thank goodness, you're back. \n\nANAKIN: I missed you, Padme. I've missed you so. \n\nPADME: There were whispers . . . that you'd been killed. I've been living with unbearable dread. \n\nANAKIN: I'm back, I'm all right. It feels like we've been apart for a lifetime. And it might have been ... If the Chancellor hadn't been kidnapped. I don't think they would have ever brought us back from the Outer Rim sieges. \n\nANAKIN starts to give her another kiss. She steps back. \n\nPADME: Wait, not here . . . \n\nHe grabs her again. \n\nANAKIN: Yes, here! I'm tired of all this deception. I don't care if they know we're married. \n\nPADME: Anakin, don't say things like that. You're important to the Republic ... to ending this war. I love you more than anything, but I won't let you give up your life as a Jedi for me . . . \n\nANAKIN: I've given my life to the Jedi order, but I'd only give up my life, for you. \n\nPADME: (playfully) I wouldn't like that. I wouldn't like that one bit. Patience, my handsome Jedi . . . Come to me later. \n\nANAKIN embraces her, then looks at her. \n\nANAKIN: Are you all right? You're trembling. What's going on? \n\nPADME: I'm just excited to see you. \n\nANAKIN: That's not it. I sense more . . . what is it? \n\nPADME: Nothing . . . nothing . . . \n\nANAKIN: You're frightened. (a little angry) Tell me what's going on! \n\nPADME begins to cry. \n\nPADME: You've been gone five months . . . it's been very hard for me. I've never felt so alone. There's . . . \n\nANAKIN: . . . Is there someone else? \n\nPADME: (peeved, angry) No! Why do you think that? Your jealousy upsets me so much, Anakin. I do nothing to betray you, yet you still don't trust me. Nothing has changed. \n\nANAKIN: (sheepish) I'm afraid of losing you, Padme . . . that's all. \n\nPADME: I will never stop loving you, Anakin. My only fear is losing you. \n\nANAKIN: It's just that I've never seen you like this . . . \n\nPADME: Something wonderful has happened. \n\nThey look at each other for a long moment. \n\nPADME: (continuing) I'm . . . Annie, I'm pregnant. \n\nANAKIN is stunned. He thinks through all of the ramifications of this.

I've never been so happy as I am at this moment. \n\nPADME: Annie, I want to have our baby back home on Naboo. We could go to the lake country where no one would know . . . where we would be safe.

The Council asked me to approach you on this personally. \n\nANAKIN: The Chancellor is not a bad man, Obi-Wan. He befriended me. He's watched out for me ever since I arrived here. \n\nOBI-WAN: That is why you must help us, Anakin. Our allegiance is to the Senate, not to its leader who has managed to stay in office long after his term has expired. \n\nANAKIN: Master, the Senate demanded that he stay longer. \n\nOBI-WAN: Yes, but use your feelings, Anakin. Something is out of place. \n\nANAKIN: You're asking me to do something against the Jedi Code. Against the Republic. Against a mentor . . . and a friend. That's what's out of place here. Why are you asking this of me? \n\nOBI-WAN: The Council is asking you. \n\n85",

I think this war is destroying the principles of the Republic. \n\nPADME: Have you ever considered that we may be on the wrong side? \n\nANAKIN: (suspicious) What do you mean? \n\nPADME: What if the democracy we thought we were serving no longer exists, and the Republic has become the very evil we have been fighting to destroy? \n\nANAKIN: I don't believe that. And you're sounding like a Separatist! \n\nPADME: Anakin, this war represents a failure to listen . . . Now, you're closer to the Chancellor than anyone. Please, please ask him to stop the fighting and let diplomacy resume. \n\nANAKIN: (growing angry) Don't ask me to do that, Padme. Make a motion in the Senate, where that kind of a request belongs. I'm not your errand boy. I'm not anyone's errand boy! \n\nPADME: What is it? \n\nANAKIN: Nothing. \n\nPADME: Don't do this . . . don't shut me out.

Come closer. I have good news. Our Clone Intelligence Units have discovered the location of General Grievous. He is hiding in the Utapau system. \n\nANAKIN: At last, we'll be able to capture that monster and end this war. \n\nPALPATINE: I would worry about the collective wisdom of the Council if they didn't select you for this assignment. You are the best choice by far � but, they can't always be trusted to do the right thing. \n\nANAKIN: They try. \n\nPALPATINE: Sit down, (to his aides) Leave us. \n\nANAKIN sits next to PALPATINE. The Chancellor leans over to him. \n\nPALPATINE: (continuing) Anakin, you know I'm not able to rely on the Jedi Council. If they haven't included you in their plot, they soon will. \n\nANAKIN: I'm not sure I understand. \n\nPALPATINE: You must sense what I have come to suspect . . . the Jedi Council want control of the Republic . . . they're planning to betray me. \n\nANAKIN: I don't think . . . \n\nPALPATINE: Anakin, search your feelings. You know, don't you? \n\nANAKIN: I know they don't trust you . . . \n\nPALPATINE: Or the Senate . . . or the Republic . . . or democracy for that matter. \n\nANAKIN: I have to admit my trust in them has been shaken. \n\nPALPATINE: Why? They asked you to do something that made you feel dishonest, didn't they? \n\nANAKIN doesn't say anything. He simply looks down. \n\nPALPATINE: (continuing) They asked you to spy on me, didn't they? \n\nANAKIN: I don't know ... I don't know what to say. \n\nPALPATINE: Remember back to your early teachings. Anakin. \"All those who gain power are afraid to lose it.\" Even the Jedi. \n\nANAKIN: The Jedi use their power for good. \n\nPALPATINE: Good is a point of view, Anakin. And the Jedi point of view is not the only valid one. The Dark Lords of the Sith believe in security and justice also, yet they are considered by the Jedi to be. . . \n\nANAKIN: . . . evil. \n\nPALPATINE: . . . from a Jedi's point of view. The Sith and the Jedi are similar in almost every way, including their quest for greater power. The difference between the two is the Sith are not afraid of the dark side of the Force. That is why they are more powerful. \n\nANAKIN: The Sith rely on their passion for their strength. They think inward, only about themselves. \n\nPALPATINE: And the Jedi don't? \n\nANAKIN: The Jedi are selfless . . . they only care about others. \n\nPALPATINE smiles. \n\nPALPATINE: Or so you've been trained to believe. Why is it, then, that they have asked you to do something you feel is wrong? \n\nANAKIN: I'm not sure it's wrong. \n\nPALPATINE: Have they asked you to betray the Jedi code? The Constitution? A friendship? Your own values? Think. Consider their motives. Keep your mind clear of assumptions. The fear of losing power is a weakness of both the Jedi and the Sith. \n\nANAKIN is deep in thought. \n\nPALPATINE: (continuing) Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis \"the wise\"? \n\nANAKIN: No. \n\nPALPATINE: I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midi-chlorians to create life ... He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. \n\nANAKIN: He could actually save people from death? \n\nPALPATINE: The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. \n\nANAKIN: What happened to him? \n\nPALPATINE: He became so powerful . . . the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. (smiles) Plagueis never saw it coming. It's ironic he could save others from death, but not himself. \n\nANAKIN: Is it possible to learn this power? \n\nPALPATINE: Not from a Jedi. \n\n89",

Chancellor Palpatine managed to escape your grip, General, without Count Dooku. I have doubts about your ability to keep us safe. \n\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: Be thankful, Viceroy, you have not found yourself in my grip . . .

Surely you realize you're doomed, (to droids) Kill him! \n\nAbout a HUNDRED BATTLE DROIDS surround OBI-WAN, GENERAL GRIEVOUS, and his BODYGUARDS. OBI-WAN looks around, then walks right up to GENERAL GRIEVOUS. \nThey stare at each other for a moment. \n\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: Enough of this. \n\nThe BODYGUARDS raise their power staffs to knock OBI-WAN away, but OBI-WAN ducks as the deadly staffs whistle over his head. The Jedi's lightsaber ignites, and OBI-WAN deftly cuts one BODYGUARD in two. His staff flies into the air and is caught by GENERAL GRIEVOUS. The other THREE BODYGUARDS attack OBI-WAN with an intense fury. \nOBI-WAN uses the Force to release apiece of equipment from the ceiling. It drops on the BODYGUARDS, smashing them. OBI-WAN walks toward GRIEVOUS, slashing the last BODYGUARD to pieces. BATTLE DROIDS move toward OBI-WAN. \n\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: Back away. I will deal with this Jedi slime myself. \n\nOBI-WAN: Your move. \n\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: You fool. I have been trained in your Jedi arts by Count Dooku himself. Attack, Kenobi. \n\nHis arms separate and grab all four lightsabers on his belt. His four arms create a flashing display of swordsmanship. \n\nOBI-WAN: You forget I trained the Jedi that defeated Count Dooku! \n\nOBI-WAN is hard-pressed to defend himself against the deadly onslaught. They fight across the control room as the BATTLE DROID SHARPSHOOTERS try to pick off the Jedi. OBI-WAN mounts a ferocious counterattack and cuts off one of GRIEVOUS's hands. A loud EXPLOSION is heard echoing throughout the sinkhole. GENERAL GRIEVOUS and OBI-WAN glance to the entrance of the control center and see CLONE TROOPS in the distance, attacking DROIDS in the sinkhole. On the far wall of the sinkhole, CLONES can be seen rappelling onto balconies. \n\nOBI-WAN: I may not defeat your droids, but my troops certainly will. \n\nGENERAL GRIEVOUS: Army or not, you must realize you are doomed. \n\nOBI-WAN: I don't think so. \n\nTWENTY CLONES suddenly rappel into the entrance of the control center, ray guns blazing. Chaos. Laser bolts fly everywhere as the DROIDS return fire. OBI-WAN attacks GENERAL GRIEVOUS, who defends himself rigorously with one of his bodyguard's electro-staffs. OBI-WAN uses the Force to hurl GENERAL GRIEVOUS backwards. He falls onto a lower platform and OBI-WAN jumps down after him. \n\n113",

No!!! \n\nVADER SCREAMS, breaks his bonds to the table, and steps forward, waving his hands, causing objects to fly around the room.

Oh, \n               here...\n\n     He walks over to a shelf behind them and gets a shoe box \n     sized container from off it.\n\n                            SAUNDAN\n               Here's a hot little item that seems to be \n               moving pretty rapidly these days.\n\n     He sets the box on the table and opens it.

I know just why you're \n               calling. You're wondering when that \n               shaggy carpet you ordered will arrive at \n               your home.\n\n     Malla growls in agreement with his assumption.\n\n                            SAUNDAN\n               Let me assure you madam, it's on its way. \n               You know, it was made especially for you \n               by a little old woman four planets away. \n               She did it all by herself. In fact, you \n               might say she did it by Han... Solo.\n\n     Malla growls enthusiastically at him.\n\n                            SAUNDAN\n               Tho' it's going to take some time to get \n               to you.

By the way, I'll be by later to \n               drop off that extra proton energy pack.\n\n     Malla waves farewell and growls.\n\n                            SAUNDAN\n               You're welcome.\n\n     The call is terminated. Saundan turns back to the Guard \n     who is still browsing around the shop. He then proceeds \n     to pick up the item from the box that he was showing \n     before the wall screen call.\n\n                            SAUNDAN\n                    (to guard)\n               What's a matter?

Wonderful! Just adds \n               that touch of piquancy. There we go. \n               Very nice. Um! Now we add enough liquid \n               to cover. \n\n     They both pour liquid into their pots.\n\n                           CHEF GORMAANDA\n               And guess what we're ready for now: the \n               cooking! Step one - we stir the mixture. \n               Stir, stir, stir, stir, stir, stir, stir, \n               stir, stir, stir, stir, very nice. \n\n     Chef Gormaanda stirs her mixture with every \"stir\" she says \n     with a spoon.

Malla follows\n     suit.\n\n                           CHEF GORMAANDA\n               So it's  stir, whip, stir, whip, whip, \n               whip, stir, stir, whip, stir, whip, whip, \n               whip, stir. Now, let's try it again \n               together at an increased tempo because \n               precision is very important in this \n               recipe and we do want a fine consistency, \n               don't we? So, and on the count of one - \n               stir, whip, stir, whip, whip, whip, stir, \n               stir, whip, stir, whip, whip, whip, stir. \n               Come on, faster altogether now. Cooking \n               can be fun. \n                    (faster)\n               Stir, whip, stir, whip, whip, whip, stir, \n               stir, whip, stir, whip, whip, whip, stir. \n               Wah! Having fun, having fun, alright. \n               Having it all nicely, now. Step three - \n               we also have to beat. \n\n     A \"third\" hand comes from behind Chef Gormaanda and picks up a\n     mallet. It places it in the pot.\n\n                           CHEF GORMAANDA\n               So it's: beat, beat, beat, stir, whip, \n               stir, whip, beat, beat, stir. That's not \n               right. I'm sorry. Stir, whip, stir, whip, \n               whip, whip, stir, beat, stir, whip, stir, \n               whip, whip, whip, stir, beat. A ha ha,ha \n               ha ha, huh huh huh, huh huh huh. Coming... \n               coming along nicely. Mmmm, starting to \n               have a fine aroma.\n\n     Chef Gormaanda starts to sneeze. A \"fourth\" hand appears from\n     behind the cook. The hand puts a finger to her nose to \n     stop the sneeze.\n\n                           CHEF GORMAANDA\n               Whew, caught it just in time. Now at this \n               time, I usually like to taste the broth. \n               So, we'll have a little taste and see how \n               it's coming along. \n\n     The fourth hand picks up a ladle and dips it in the pot \n     to get some broth. Chef Gormaanda tastes it. Malla just picks up \n     her whole pot and tastes it from there.\n\n                           CHEF GORMAANDA\n               Mmmm, a little bit more turshum. A bit \n               negavo. A little tunkell. One for the pot, \n               um! Coming along very nice. Mmm! Oh, \n               wonderful! Coming along nicely...\n\n     Malla gets frustrated with keeping up with Chef Gormaanda and \n     shuts off her monitor. She takes her pot and puts it on \n     the floor.\n\n17.",

That's uh, one of me. I've \n               gained quite a bit of weight since then. \n\n     Saundan laughs nervously again. The Imperial guard kneels \n     down in front of Lumpy\n\n                            IMPERIAL GUARD\n                    (to Lumpy)\n               Hello little guy.

Malla steps\n     forward and growls angrily at him. Saundan steps between \n     them and separates them.\n\n                            SAUNDAN\n                    (to guard)\n               Excuse me. I beg your pardon. Uh, maybe \n               you know my brother's boy. He's a member \n               of the Imperial militia. He must be 24 or \n               25 years old by know. Good little guy...\n\n                            IMPERIAL OFFICER\n                    (to Saundan)\n               Your identification is in order. You can \n               go now.\n\n     The officer walks over to Saundan and gives him back his\n     identification.\n\n                            SAUNDAN\n                    (to officer)\n               Thank you, thank you very much. I just \n               have a little more work to finish up here \n               and uh, oh by the way, uh, while I'm \n               finishing up here uh, why don't you boys \n               uh, take it easy. Relax. Put your feet up \n               and make yourself at home. Wookiee food \n               isn't the greatest but I'm sure I can \n               whip something up in the kitchen that we \n               can all eat.\n                    (to Malla)\n               Uh, you don't mind do ya, Malla?\n\n     Malla growls something back at Saundan.\n\n                            SAUNDAN\n                    (forcefully)\n               Malla will you come in the kitchen to \n               help me.\n\n     Malla goes to the table to get her \"boom box\" on the way \n     to the kitchen. The guard pulls it away from her and \n     examines it. Malla howls in anger.\n\n                            SAUNDAN\n                    (to guard)\n               What are doing with that thing? That's a \n               very delicate piece of workmanship.\n\n     Saundan goes to Malla and comforts her. The guard puts the\n     machine back on the table.\n\n                            SAUNDAN\n                    (to Malla)\n               Alright Malla, it's alright.\n                    (to guard)\n               The slightest jarring will mess up the \n               whole works. If you're going to play \n               around with it let me show you how.\n\n     He reaches towards the machine and a stormtrooper pulls \n     his blaster and puts it in his face.\n                            SAUNDAN\n               Relax, I gotta turn it on, don't I? \n\n     The guard motions for the stormtrooper to put his blaster \n     up. The stormtrooper complies.\n\n                            SAUNDAN\n               Just sit down and enjoy it, okay?\n\n     Saundan pulls a chair out for the guard. The guard sits \n     down in it.\n \n                            SAUNDAN\n               Here we go.   \n\n     Saundan opens the front of the box which folds down. He \n     fools around needlessly with it. He then \"sees\" a bug and\n     claps it in his hands. He then drops it to the floor and\n     stomps on it. This is too much for the guard. He stands \n     up and yells at Saundan.\n\n                            IMPERIAL GUARD\n                    (angrily)\n               Will you get on with it?\n\n                            SAUNDAN\n               Okay, okay.\n\n     Saundan pushes one button on it and walks away. The box \n     starts to produce music and the guard sits back down in \n     front of it. With the beat of it a small pink light \n     flashes. A band slowly starts to appear.\n\n                            SINGER\n               God, all dignified, if you want to. What \n               I would really like to know. Will you \n               light the sky on fire? Will you light \n               tonight like you did the night before? \n               Hey! You could take me higher than the \n               diamonds in the sky. Take me, light in \n               the sky and we'll vanish without a trace \n               and we'll see God then. Temples and \n               mirrors interest me. Though all there \n               really is to know. Will you light the sky \n               on fire? Will you light the sky on fire \n               again tonight? You can take me higher \n               than the diamonds in the sky. Take me, \n               we'll vanish without a trace and then \n               we'll all see God then. On the pyramids of \n               the legend. The great god Kopa Khan came \n               from the stars and vanished. And the \n               legends say he will come back again \n               someday, someday... Will you light the \n               sky on fire? Will you light tonight like \n               you did the night before. You can take me \n               higher than the diamonds in the sky. Take \n               me, light in the sky and we'll vanish \n               without a trace, And then we'll see god \n               then. Yes, I would really like to know. \n               What I've been watching this for. Yes, I \n               would really like to know. Will you light \n               the sky on fire? Will you light the sky \n               like you did the night before? You could \n               take me higher than the diamonds in the \n               sky. Take me, we'll vanish without a \n               trace. And we'll all see God then. Vanish \n               without a trace. Vanish without a trace. \n               Come on, come on, come on, come on, come \n               on, let's vanish without a trace. Come on, \n               come on, come on, come on, come on, we'll \n               vanish without a trace.\n\n     As the music ends the band slowly disappears only to \n     leave the pulsating pink light. When the music comes to \n     an end the light stops. Saundan walks back over to the \n     guard.\n\n                            SAUNDAN\n               I knew you'd like it.\n\n                            IMPERIAL OFFICER\n               Your work here is finished.

I hope you guys find what \n               you're looking for. Keep up the good work.\n\n     Saundan turns to go and stops where the wookiees are \n     huddled.\n\n                            SAUNDAN\n                    (to Malla)\n               Malla.\n                    (to Itchy)\n               Itchy, please...\n\n     Itchy hands him the bag that he brought Lumpy's gift in\n     earlier.\n\n                            IMPERIAL OFFICER\n               Alright, finish the search of the \n               residence.\n\n     The Imperial officer snaps his fingers at his troops. \n     Saundan who is just about gone turns back into the house.\n\n                            SAUNDAN\n               Oh, I almost forgot. I want to leave you \n               my card in case you need any of uh, oh...\n\n     A stormtrooper stops him with his blaster pointed at his\n     face. Saundan turns to leave again.\n \n                            SAUNDAN\n               Okay, I'm leaving.\n\n                            IMPERIAL OFFICER\n               Investigate the upper area. Check for \n               any Rebel material. Anything to connect \n               this household with the Alliance.\n\n     Saundan again heads back into the house.\n\n                            SAUNDAN\n               Oh, don't forget about those protective \n               cases for your identification card. I \n               gotta good item... \n\n     The stormtrooper again stops Saundan with his blaster.\n\n                            SAUNDAN\n               That's it, I'm gone.\n\n     Saundan finally leaves.\n\n                            IMPERIAL OFFICER\n               Finish the search of the house. We have \n               other areas to cover today.\n\n     The officer points his hand in a stormtrooper's face.\n\n                            IMPERIAL OFFICER\n                    (to stormtrooper)\n               You! Take the upper area.\n\n     Lumpy tries to stop the stormtrooper from going upstairs \n     but is violently pushed aside by him. Malla jumps to her\n     son's aid only to be stopped by the other stormtrooper's\n     blaster in her face. The officer pushes the blaster away \n     from Malla.\n\n                            IMPERIAL OFFICER\n               Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uhh... We don't want \n               to have to hurt anyone. That's not what \n               we're here for.\n\n     The officer snaps his fingers at the stormtrooper to \n     dismiss him. The stormtrooper walks away.\n \n                            IMPERIAL OFFICER\n               But, when my men get angry I can't always \n               control them. We are going to continue \n               our search. Now keep him quiet and I'll \n               forget this ever happened.\n\n     Malla takes Lumpy over to a table and chair. There is a \n     small yellow box and pair of headphones on it. Lumpy sits\n     down and puts on the headphones. He then presses a button.\n     Strange lettering appear on the small screen. Lumpy looks\n     around to see if anyone is watching him. He sees a\n     stormtrooper and a guard going up the staircase. Lumpy \n     pushes a button on the box and a cartoon starts on the\n     screen.\n\n34.",

I felt alive \n               again. Someone made me feel like all the \n               years I've lived meant something. And all \n               you said was six simple words. \"Come back \n               soon, I'll be waiting.\"\n\n     He counts the last six words on the six fingers of his \n     left hand.\n\n                            ACKMENA\n               Well, after all, only words I probably...\n\n     He grabs her hand in his own.\n\n                            KRELMAN\n                    (interrupting)\n               ...more than words. I knew that at the \n               time. That's why I went home and thought \n               and thought about what you said.\n\n                            ACKMENA\n               Oh? What did I say?\n\n                            KRELMAN\n               It uh, it doesn't matter, silly. What you \n               said is not as important as what you meant.\n\n                            ACKMENA\n               Oh? What did I mean?\n\n                            KRELMAN\n               I decided what you meant was exactly the \n               thing I needed to hear.\n\n                            ACKMENA\n               Well, I'm glad about that.\n\n     Ackmena walks further down the bar. Krelman gets up and\n     follows her. He even goes behind the bar after her. She \n     is trying to clean behind the bar with a rag.\n\n                            KRELMAN\n               You know its funny. A man can live as \n               long as I have. Through all the ups and \n               downs and just when he thinks its all \n               over, someone cares for him again. I \n               wasn't looking for that when I came in \n               here. Maybe that's why it, it happened. \n               Because I wasn't asking for love anymore. \n               I wasn't desperate. I wasn't begging, \n               whining, ruffling, sniveling. I just came \n               in here for a drink and I find a lot more.\n\n     He hugs Ackmena from behind. She is at a loss for words.\n\n                            ACKMENA\n               Uh, uh, Kerlman...\n\n                            KRELMAN\n               Krelman.\n\n     She disengages herself from his embrace.\n\n                            ACKMENA\n               Uh, lis... listen uh, Krelman. You're, \n               you're kind and, and sweet and, and \n               terribly attractive but, if, if you're \n               saying what I think you're saying you\n               felt you meant I thought you needed to \n               hear then, I just have one thing to say. \n               I did not.\n\n                            KRELMAN\n               Ackmena, don't do this to me...\n\n                            ACKMENA\n                    (interrupting)\n               Now, please look! I have customers. \n\n     She motions for him to go back to the other side of the\n     counter and he complies.\n\n                            ACKMENA\n               Why don't you sit down. Finish your drink. \n               Have another drink. This one's on me.\n\n     Krelman is back in his seat. Ackmena pours a directly from\n     the pitcher into the top of his head.\n\n                            ACKMENA\n               Now, you stay just as long as you want. \n               But, I have business to attend to. I \n               really have no time for anything else.\n\n     She puts the pitcher down and walks away.\n\n                            KRELMAN\n               You'll change your mind. I just know you \n               will. Six simple words. I could wait \n               forever to hear it again because I know...\n\n     A customer at the bar gets up and leaves. Ackmena waves\n     farewell. \n\n                            ACKMENA\n                    (to customer)\n               Come back soon, I'll be waiting.\n\n     Krelman gets upset and puts his hood over his head. He \n     then puts his head down on the table. The wall screen \n     beeps and an Imperial officer appears on it. The music \n     and conversation stops as all attention is turned to the \n     wall screen.\n\n                            IMPERIAL OFFICER\n                    (on monitor)\n               Due to increased activity among subversive \n               forces, we are placing a curfew on the \n               entire Tatooine system effective \n               immediately. All inhabitants will return \n               to their homes at once. This order will \n               remain in effect until further notice.\n\n     All conversation resumes in the bar. Ackmena walks over \n     to the bandstand.\n\n                            ACKMENA\n                    (to band member)\n               Okay, Bobbarine. Take a break.\n\n     He says something back to her.\n\n                            ACKMENA\n               I don't know how long. Maybe forever. \n\n     The band has a fit at her answer.\n\n                            ACKMENA\n               Oh, don't leave me now. Please, please, I \n               have enough aggravation. Alright, one \n               more round before you leave. And this \n               one's on the me. \n                    (to Tork)\n               Tork, see what the boys on the bandstand \n               will have.\n\n     Tork heads over to follow her order. Ackmena goes back \n     behind the bar. She goes up to two aliens seated at the \n     bar.

    "A Star Destroyer moves through space, releasing Imperial\n    probe robots from its underside.\n\n    One of these probes zooms toward the planet Hoth and lands\n    on its ice- covered surface. An explosion marks the point\n    of impact.\n\n2",
    "A weird mechanical sound rises above the whining of the\n    wind. A strange probe robot, with several extended sensors,\n    emerges from the smoke-shrouded crater. The ominous\n    mechanical probe floats across the snow plain and disappears\n    into the distance.\n\n3",
    "A small figure gallops across the windswept ice slope. The\n    bundled rider is mounted on a large gray snow lizard, a\n    Tauntaun. Curving plumes of snow rise from beneath the\n    speeding paws of the two-legged beast.\n\n    The rider gallops up a slope and reins his lizard to a stop.\n    Pulling off his protective goggles, Luke Skywalker notices\n    something in the sky. He takes a pair of electrobinoculars\n    from his utility belt and through them sees smoke rising\n    from where the probe robot has crashed.\n\n    The wind whips at Luke's fur-lined cap and he activates a\n    comlink transmitter. His Tauntaun shifts and moans\n    nervously beneath him.\n\n                        LUKE\n                  (into comlink)\n              Echo Three to Echo Seven.   Han, old\n              buddy, do you read me?\n\n    After a little static a familiar voice is heard.\n\n                        HAN\n                  (over comlink)\n              Loud and clear, kid.   What's up?\n\n                        LUKE\n                  (into comlink)\n              Well, I finished my circle. I\n              don't pick up any life readings.\n\n                        HAN\n                  (over comlink)\n              There isn't enough life on this ice\n              cube to fill a space cruiser. The\n              sensors are placed, I'm going back.\n\n                        LUKE\n                  (into comlink)\n              Right. I'll see you shortly.\n              There's a meteorite that hit the\n              ground near here. I want to check\n              it out. It won't take long.\n\n    Luke clicks off his transmitter and reins back on his\n    nervous lizard. He pats the beast on the head to calm it.\n\n                        LUKE (CONT’D)\n              Hey, steady girl. What's the\n              matter? You smell something?\n\n    Luke takes a small device from his belt and starts to adjust\n    it when suddenly a large shadow falls over him from behind.\n    He hears a monstrous howl and turns to see an eleven-foot-\n    tall shape towering over him. It is a Wampa Ice Creature,\n    lunging at him ferociously.\n\n                        LUKE (CONT’D)\n              Aaargh!\n\n    Luke grabs for his pistol, but is hit flat in the face by a\n    huge white claw. He falls unconscious into the snow and in\n    a moment the terrified screams of the Tauntaun are cut short\n    by the horrible snap of a neck being broken.\n\n    The Wampa Ice Creature grabs Luke by one ankle and drags him\n    away across the frozen plain.\n\n4",
    "A stalwart figure rides his Tauntaun up to the entrance of\n    an enormous ice cave.\n\n5",
    "Rebel troopers rush about unloading supplies and otherwise\n    securing their new base.

Suddenly, the ship\n      lurches again, throwing Leia across the cabin into Han's\n      arms. Then, abruptly, the motion stops as suddenly as it\n      started. With some surprise, Han and Leia realize they are\n      in each other's arms.\n\n                          LEIA\n                Let go.\n\n                          HAN\n                Sshh!\n\n                          LEIA\n                Let go, please.\n\n      Leia flushes, averting her eyes. She's not exactly fighting\n      to get free. But, of course, Han blows it...\n\n                          HAN\n                Don't get excited.\n\n      The anger rises in Leia.\n\n                          LEIA\n                Captain, being held by you isn't\n                quite enough to get me excited.\n\n                          HAN\n                Sorry, sweetheart. We haven't got\n                time for anything else.\n\n      Han grins quickly wickedly at Leia as he turns and exits\n      through the door. Leia's confused emotions show clearly on\n      her lovely face.\n\n148",

She\n      has never been kissed like this before, and it almost makes\n      her faint. When he stops, she regains her breath and tries\n      to work up some indignation, but finds it hard to talk.\n\n      Suddenly, Threepio appears in the doorway, speaking\n      excitedly.\n\n                          THREEPIO\n                Sir, sir!

Holding his lit saber before him, he sees a lizard\n      crawling up the side of the cave and a snake wrapped around\n      the branches of a tree. Luke draws a deep breath, then\n      pushes deeper into the cave.\n\n      The space widens around him, but he feels that rather than\n      sees it.

He is upon\n      the youth in seconds, but Luke sidesteps perfectly and\n      slashes at Vader with his sword.\n\n      Vader is decapitated. His helmet-encased head flies from\n      his shoulders as his body disappears into the darkness. The\n      metallic banging of the helmet fills the cave as Vader's\n      head spins and bounces, smashes on the floor, and finally\n      stops. For an instant it rests on the floor, then it cracks\n      vertically. The black helmet and breath mask fall away to\n      reveal... Luke's head.\n\n      Across the space, the standing Luke gasps at the sight, wide-\n      eyed in terror.\n\n      The decapitated head fades away, as in a vision.\n\n167",

Obi-Wan knew this to be\n          true.\n\n                    LUKE\n          No!\n\nBehind Luke the hydraulic elevator cover has opened\nnoiselessly. All the while, Luke slowly, cautiously moves\nback, away from the Dark Lord.\n\nSuddenly, Vader attacks so forcefully that Luke loses his\nbalance and falls back into the opening. There is a rumble,\nand in an instant freezing steam rises to obscure Vader's\nvision.   Vader turns aside and deactivates his sword.\n\n                    VADER\n          All to easy. Perhaps you are not\n          as strong as the Emperor thought.\n\nThrough the steam behind Vader something blurs upward.\nLiquid metal begins to pour into the pit.\n\nVader turns around - and then looks up. He sees Luke, who\nhas leaped fifteen feet straight up and who now hangs from\nsome hoses on the carbonite outlet.\n\n                    VADER (CONT’D)\n          Impressive... most impressive.\n\nLuke jumps down to the platform where he is separated from\nVader by the steaming carbonite pit. He raises his hand.\nHis sword, which had fallen on another part of the platform,\nswiftly jumps into his outstretched hand and is instantly\nignited. Vader immediately lights his sword as well.\n\n                    VADER (CONT’D)\n          Obi-Wan has taught you well. You\n          have controlled your fear... now\n          release your anger.\n\nLuke is more cautious, controlling his anger. He begins to\nretreat as Vader goads him on. As Luke takes a defensive\nposition, he realizes he has been foolhardy. A quick sword\nexchange and Luke forces Vader back. Another exchange and\nVader retreats. Luke presses forward.\n\n                    VADER (CONT’D)\n          Only your hatred can destroy me.\n\nBreathing hard, Luke jumps in the air, turning a somersault\nover Vader. He lands on the floor and slashes at Vader as\nthe room continues to fill up with steam.\n\n      Vader retreats before Luke's skillful sword. Vader blocks\n      the sword, but looses his balance and falls into the outer\n      rim of pipes. The energy Luke has used to stop Vader has\n      brought him to the point of collapse. Luke moves to the\n      edge and looks down, but sees no sign of Vader. He then\n      deactivates his sword, hooks it on his belt, and lowers\n      himself into the pit.\n\n224",
    "Moving through a tunnellike entrance, Luke cautiously\n      approaches the reactor room. He ignites his sword and moves\n      into the room and toward a large window as Vader enters.\n\n      Luke raises his sword and moves forward to attack.\n\n      Behind Luke a large piece of machinery detaches itself from\n      the wall and comes smashing forward toward his back. Luke\n      turns and cuts it in half just as another machine comes\n      hurtling at him. Using the Force, Luke manages to deflect\n      it and send it flying as if it had hit an invisible shield.\n\n      A large pipe detaches and comes flying at Luke. He deflects\n      it. Sparking wires pull out of the wall and begin to whip at\n      the youth. Small tools and equipment come flying at him.\n      Bombardment from all sides, Luke does his best to deflect\n      everything, but soon he is bloodied and bruised. Finally,\n      one machine glances off his and goes flying out the large\n      window. A fierce wind blows into the room, unmoving, stands\n      the dark, rocklike figure of Vader.\n\n      A piece of machinery hits Luke and he is knocked out of the\n      window.\n\n225",

    "The throne room is filled with the vilest, most grotesque\n    CREATURES ever conceived in the universe.

    "One of Jabba's Gamorrean guards marches Artoo and Threepio\n     down a dank, shadowy passageway lined with holding cells.

As the\ndoor snaps shut, a muffled growl is followed by a hideous\nscream. Jabba and his monstrous friends laugh hysterically\nand several revelers hurry over to watch her fate through a\ngrate.\n\nThreepio cringes and glances wistfully at the carbonite form\nof Han Solo, but is immediately distracted by a gunshot\noffscreen. An unnatural quiet sweeps the boisterous\ngathering. On the far side of the room, the crush of\ndebauchers moves aside to allow the approach of two guards\nfollowed by BOUSHH, an oddly cloaked bounty hunter, leading\nhis captive, Han Solo's copilot, CHEWBACCA THE WOOKIEE.\n\nBib takes his place next to his disgusting master, and\nwhispers into his ear, pointing at Chewbacca and the bounty\nhunter. Jabba listens intently, then the bounty hunter bows\nbefore the gangster and speaks a greeting in a strange,\nelectronically processed tongue (Ubese).\n\n                    BOUSHH   (IN UBESE SUBTITLED)\n          I have come for the bounty on this\n          Wookiee.\n\n                    THREEPIO\n          Oh, no!

No less.\n\nJabba immediately flies into a rage, knocking the golden\ndroid off the raised throne into a clattering heap on the\nfloor.

The droid is very nervous and Jabba is getting\nvery impatient.\n\n                     THREEPIO (CONT’D)\n          Because he's holding a thermal\n          detonator.\n\nThe guards instantly back away, as do most of the other\nmonsters in the room. Jabba stares at the silver ball, which\nbegins to glow in the bounty hunter's hand. The room has\nfallen into a tense hush. Jabba stares at the bounty hunter\nmalevolently until a sly grin creeps across his vast mouth\nand he begins to laugh.\n\n                    JABBA (IN HUTTESE SUBTITLED)\n          This bounty hunter is my kind of\n          scum.

And I suggest you take it.\n\nBib and the other monsters study the bounty hunter and wait\nfor his reaction.

The band starts up and\n     dancing girls take the center of the floor, to the hoots of\n     the loudly appreciative creatures.\n\n     Boushh leans against a column with gunfighter cool and\n     surveys the scene, his gaze stopping only when it connects\n     with a glare from across the room. Boba Fett is watching him.\n     Boushh shifts slightly, cradling his weapon lovingly. Boba\n     Fett shifts with equally ominous arrogance.\n\n12",

    "Silence. The room is deserted, only the awful debris of the\n     alien celebration giving mute witness to the activity here\n     before. Several drunk creatures lie unconscious around the\n     room, snoring loudly.\n\n     A shadowy figure moves stealthily among the columns at the\n     perimeter of the room and is revealed to be Boushh, the\n     bounty hunter.

The heavy case\n     slowly lowers to the floor of the alcove.\n\n     Boushh steps up to the case, studying Han, and then turns to\n     the controls on the side of the coffin. He activates a series\n     of switches and, after one last hesitant look at Han, slides\n     the de-carbonization lever. The case begins to emit a sound\n     as the hard shell covering the contours of Han's face begins\n     to melt away.\n\nThe bounty hunter watches as Han's body is freed of its\nmetallic coat and his forearms and hands, previously raised\nin reflexive protest, drop slackly to his side.

The\n     hideous beast closes in on him.\n\n     The Rancor moves past Luke, and as the guard continues to\n     scramble, the Rancor picks him up and pops him into its\n     slavering jaws. A few screams, and the guard is swallowed\n     with a gulp. The audience cheers and laughs at the guard's\n     fate.\n\n     The monster turns and starts for Luke. The young Jedi dashes\n     away just ahead of the monster's swipe at him, and picks up\n     the long arm bone of an earlier victim. The monster grabs\n     Luke and brings him up to his salivating mouth. At the last\n     moment, Luke wedges the bone in the monster's mouth and is\n     dropped to the floor. The monster bellows in rage and flails\n     about, hitting the side of the pit, causing an avalanche.\n\n     The monster crushes the bone in its jaws and sees Luke, who\n     squeezes into a crevice in the pit wall. Luke looks past the\n     monster to the holding cave beyond. On the far side of the\n     holding cave is a utility door--if only he can get to it. The\n     Rancor spots Luke and reaches into the crevice for him.

He reaches the door and pushes a button to open\n     it. When he succeeds, he sees a heavy barred gate between him\n     and safety. Beyond the gate two guards look up from their\n     dinner. Luke turns to see the monster heading for him, and\n     pulls with all his might on the gate.\n\n     The guards move to the gate and start poking at the young\n     Jedi with spears, laughing.\n\n     Luke crouches (against the wall) as the monster starts to\n     reach for him. Suddenly he notices a main door control panel\n     halfway up the wall. As the Rancor moves in for the kill,\n     Luke picks up a skull from the cave floor and hurls it at the\n     panel. The giant overhead door comes crashing down on the\n     beast's head, squashing it like a sledgehammer on an egg.\n\n     A startled gasp is heard from the stunned court. There's\n     consternation at this turn of events. Heads look to Jabba,\n     who is actually turning red with anger. Leia cannot suppress\n     her joy. Jabba utters harsh commands to his guards and they\n     hurry off.\n\n                         JABBA (IN HUTTESE SUBTITLED)\n               Bring me Solo and the Wookiee.

Where?\n\n     The space pirate turns around blindly, and the long spear in\n     his hand whacks squarely in the middle of Boba's rocket pack.\n\n     The impact of the swing causes the rocket pack to ignite.\n     Boba blasts off, flying over the second skiff like a missile,\n     smashing against the side of the huge Sail Barge and sliding\n     away into the pit.

Luke\n     leaps from the skiff, across a chasm of air, to the sheer\n     metallic side of the Sail Barge. Barely able to get a\n     fingerhold, he begins a painful climb up the hull, when\n     suddenly an ax smashes through a window an inch from his\n     head.

Luke's bike is a blur to the two\npursuing scouts as they zip by him on either side. Luke slams\nhis bike into forward and starts firing away, having switched\nplaces with his pursuers in a manner of seconds. Luke's aim\nis good and one scout's bike is blasted out of control. It\nexplodes against a tree trunk.\n\nThe scout's cohort takes one glance back at the flash and\nshifts into turbo drive, going even faster. Luke keeps on his\ntail.\n\nFAR AHEAD, Leia and the first scout are doing a highspeed\nslalom through the death-dealing trunks. Now Leia aims her\nbike skyward and rises out of sight.\n\nThe scout turns in confusion, unable to see his pursuer.\nSuddenly, Leia dives down upon him from above, cannon\nblasting. The scout's bike takes a glancing hit.\n\nLeia moves in alongside him. The scout eyes her beside him,\nreaches down, and pulls out a handgun. Before Leia can react,\nthe scout has blasted her bike, sending it out of control.\nLeia dives off as her bike explodes against a tree. The happy\nscout looks back at the explosion. But when he turns forward\nagain, he is on a collision course with a giant fallen tree.\nHe hits his brakes to no avail and disappears in a\nconflagration.\n\nANOTHER PART OF THE FOREST: Luke and the last remaining scout\ncontinue their weaving chase through the trees. Now Luke\nmoves up close. The scout responds by slamming his bike into\nLuke's. A fallen tree forms a bridge across their path. The\nscout zips under. Luke goes over the top and crashes his bike\ndown on the scout's. Both riders look ahead - a wide trunk\nlooms directly in Luke's path, but the scout's bike beside\nhim makes it almost impossible for him to avoid it.\n\n     Luke banks with all his might, leaning almost horizontal over\n     the scout's bike, and is able to make it by, just clipping\n     the tree. When he straightens, he and the scout discover that\n     their two bikes have locked front vanes and are moving as\n     one.\n\n     Another big tree looms in Luke's path. He reacts\n     instinctively and dives off his bike. The two bikes come\n     apart a second before Luke's explodes against a tree. The\n     scout sweeps out and circles back to find Luke.\n\n     Luke rises from the undergrowth as the scout bears down on\n     him and opens fire with his laser cannon. Luke ignites his\n     laser sword and begins deflecting the bolts. The scout's bike\n     keeps coming and it appears that in a second it will cut Luke\n     in half. At the last instant, Luke steps aside and chops off\n     the bike's control vanes with one mighty slash. The scout's\n     bike begins to shudder, then, pitching and rolling, it rises\n     up to slam directly into a tree in a giant ball of fire.\n\n66",

Come\n          on, sit down.\n\nWicket holds his spear up warily and growls at her like a\npuppy. Leia pats the log again.\n\n                     LEIA (CONT’D)\n          I promise I won't hurt you. Now\n          come here.\n\nMore growls and squeaks from the little bear creature.\n\n                    LEIA (CONT’D)\n          All right. You want something to\n          eat?\n\nShe takes a scrap of food out of her pocket and offers it to\nhim. Wicket takes a step backward, then cocks his head and\nmoves cautiously toward Leia, chattering in his squeaky Ewok\nlanguage.\n\n                    LEIA (CONT’D)\n          That's right. Come on. Hmmm?\n\nSniffing the food curiously, the Ewok comes toward Leia and\nsits on the log beside her. She takes off her helmet, and the\nlittle creature jumps back, startled again. He runs along the\nlog, pointing his spear at her and chattering a blue streak.\nLeia holds out the helmet to him.\n\n                    LEIA (CONT’D)\n          Look, it's a hat. It's not gonna\n          hurt you. Look. You're a jittery\n          little thing, aren't you?\n\nReassured, Wicket lowers his spear and climbs back on the\nlog, coming to investigate the helmet. Suddenly his ears perk\nup and he begins to sniff the air. He looks around warily,\nwhispering some Ewokese warning to Leia.\n\n                    LEIA (CONT’D)\n          What is it?\n\nSuddenly a laser bolt comes out of the foliage and explodes\non the log next to Leia. Leia and Wicket both roll backwards\noff the log, hiding behind it. Leia holds her own laser gun\nready, while Wicket disappears underneath the log. Another\nshot, and still no sight of anyone in the forest.\n\n     Then Leia senses something and turns to find a large IMPERIAL\n     SCOUT standing over her with his weapon pointed at her head.\n     He reaches out his hand for her weapon.\n\n     SCOUT #l Freeze!   Come on, get up!\n\n     She hands the weapon over, as a second scout emerges from the\n     foliage in front of the log.\n\n                         SCOUT #1\n               Go get your ride and take her back\n               to base.\n\n                           SCOUT #2\n               Yes, sir.\n\n     The second scout starts toward his bike, as Wicket, crouched\n     under the log, extends his spear and hits the first scout on\n     the leg. The scout jumps and lets out an exclamation, and\n     looks down at Wicket, puzzled. Leia grabs a branch and knocks\n     him out. She dives for his laser pistol, and the second\n     scout, now on his bike, takes off. Leia fires away and hits\n     the escaping bike, causing it to crash into the first scout's\n     bike, which flies end over end and explodes. The forest is\n     quiet once more. Wicket pokes his fuzzy head up from behind\n     the log and regards Leia with a new respect. He mumbles his\n     awe. Leia hurries over, looking around all the time, and\n     motions the chubby little creature into the dense foliage.\n\n                         LEIA\n               Come on, let's get outta here.\n\n     As they move into the foliage, Wicket takes the lead. He\n     shrieks and tugs at Leia to follow him.\n\n68",

Ohhh!\n\n     Chief Chirpa yells orders to the cowering Ewoks. They rush up\n     and release the bound prisoners. Luke and Han enfold Leia in\n     a group embrace. Luke notices the spinning Threepio, with\n     Artoo beeping up at him, and slowly lowers the golden droid\n     and the throne to the ground. Logray orders the little droid\n     cut down. Artoo crashes to the ground. When the Ewoks set him\n     upright, the little droid is fighting mad. Artoo beeps a blue\n     streak at the nearest Ewok, and begins pursuing him, finally\n     getting close enough to zap him with an electric charge. The\n     Ewok jumps two feet in the air and runs away, screaming.

With one final burst of his once awesome\nstrength, Darth Vader hurls the Emperor's body into the\nbottomless shaft.\n\n      The Emperor's body spins helplessly into the void, arcing as\n      it falls into the abyss.
