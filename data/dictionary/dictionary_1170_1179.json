How long've we known each\n           other?\n          Rey and Finn arrive under the gang.

Han's face GOES WHITE as he\n          turns to the OTHER END OF THE CORRIDOR, where KANJIKLUB\n          MEMBERS APPEAR. A GANG in a MEDIEVAL BANDITO style.\n          Han smiles uncomfortably at the Kanjiklub members. Its\n          LEADER, TASU LEECH, out front. Han tries to play it off:\n\n                          HAN\n           Tasu Leech. Good to see you.\n          Tasu speaks an alien language, we SUBTITLE:\n\n                          TASU LEECH\n           Wrong again, Solo.

And\n           two fugitives.\n          Finn and Rey SUDDENLY STOP CRAWLING, tense.\n          BB-8 hides behind Han's leg. PUSH IN ON Han as he realizes:\n          Finn and Rey are in real trouble.\n\n                          HAN\n           First I've heard of it.\n          Below the grating, Finn and Rey look at each other, afraid.\n          Above, another Kanjiklubber (RAZOO QIN-FEE) says (SUBTITLED):\n\n                          RAZOO QIN-FEE\n           Search the freighter.\n          One of the Kanjiklubbers begins moving down the corridor,\n          AIMING A FLASHLIGHT DOWN BELOW, searching for:\n          FINN AND REY, in a QUIET PANIC BELOW: THEY START CRAWLING\n          FAST in the opposite direction they came.\n          Rey crawls off fast, Finn follows. They quickly arrive at\n          a JUNCTION BOX AREA, Rey looking at the controls.\n\n                          REY\n           Wait wait wait wait. If we close\n           the blast doors in that corridor, we\n           can trap both gangs!\n\n                          FINN\n           Close the blast doors from here?\n\n                          REY\n           Resetting the fuses should do it.\n          Rey begins RESETTING the FUSES, SPARKS shooting from them as\n          they do. Finn quickly joins in.\n          Rey and Finn FINISH resetting the fuses boxes. Rey smiles\n          optimistically. Finn looks hopeful too.\n          DOWN AN EMPTY ROW OF LARGE CONTAINERS, which OPEN -- and a\n          GIANT RATHTAR -- an ENORMOUS, FIERCE AND RAVENOUS LAND OCTOPUS --\n\n          SLITHERS OUT OF ITS CAGE!\n          BACK UP TOP as BANKS OF LIGHTS BEGIN GOING OFF, ONE BY ONE.\n          The GANGS look around.\n          Han's eyes go wide -- he gets it -- and it's bad.

I got a bad feeling about this...\n          Suddenly all the LIGHTS COME ON AGAIN -- even down below,\n          where Rey realizes it hasn't gone as planned.\n\n                          REY\n           Oh no.\n\n                          FINN\n           Oh no, what?\n\n                          REY\n\n                          (PALE)\n           Wrong fuses.\n\n          IN ANOTHER CORRIDOR, BACK WITH THE GANGS:\n\n                          BALA-TIK\n           Kill them!

The gang FIRES BACK -- BLASTS FLY!\n          Han and Chewie react, flinching -- then turn to Kanjiklub as\n          a RATHTAR APPEARS BEHIND THEM, ROARING DEAFENINGLY!
