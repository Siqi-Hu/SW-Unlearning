The Sandpeople ransack the speeder, throwing parts\n     and supplies in all directions. Suddenly they stop. Then\n     everything is quiet for a few moments. A great howling moan\n     is heard echoing throughout the canyon which sends the\n     Sandpeople fleeing in terror.\n\nArtoo moves even tighter into the shadows as the slight\nswishing sound that frightened off the Sandpeople grows even\ncloser, until a shabby old desert-rat-of-a-man appears and\nleans over Luke. His ancient leathery face, cracked and\nweathered by exotic climates is set off by dark, penetrating\neyes and a scraggly white beard. Ben Kenobi squints his eyes\nas he scrutinizes the unconscious farm boy. Artoo makes a\nslight sound and Ben turns and looks right at him.\n\n                    BEN\n          Hello there! Come here my little\n          friend. Don't be afraid.\n\nArtoo waddles over to were Luke lies crumpled in a heap and\nbegins to whistle and beep his concern.

Your\n          father wanted you to have this when\n          you were old enough, but your uncle\n          wouldn't allow it.

This is\n          the weapon of a Jedi Knight. Not as\n          clumsy or as random as a blaster.\n\nLuke pushes a button on the handle. A long beam shoots out\nabout four feet and flickers there.

Look, here are Gaffi\n               sticks, Bantha tracks. It's just...\n               I never heard of them hitting\n               anything this big before.\n\n     Ben is crouching in the sand studying the tracks.\n\n                         BEN\n               They didn't.
