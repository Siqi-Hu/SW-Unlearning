He is distraught. \nPADME descends the stairs and joins ANAKIN on the veranda. She takes his hand. He doesn't look at her. \n\nPADME: What's bothering you? \n\nANAKIN: Nothing . . . \n\nANAKIN touches the japor snippet around PADME'S neck, that Anakin gave her when he was a small boy. \n\nANAKIN: (continuing) I remember when I gave this to you. \n\nPADME: Anakin, how long is it going to take for us to be honest with each other? \n\nANAKIN: It was a dream. \n\nPADME: Bad? \n\nANAKIN: Like the ones I used to have about my mother just before she died. \n\nPADME: And? \n\nANAKIN: It was about you. \n\nThey look at each other. A moment of concern passes between them. \n\nPADME: Tell me. \n\nANAKIN: It was only a dream. \n\nPADME gives him a long, worried look. ANAKIN takes a deep breath. \n\nANAKIN: (continuing) You die in childbirth . . . \n\nPADME: And the baby? \n\nANAKIN: I don't know. \n\nPADME: It was only a dream. \n\nANAKIN takes PADME in his arms. \n\nANAKIN: . . . I won't let this one become real, Padme. \n\nThey embrace, then part. \n\nPADME: Anakin, this baby will change our lives. I doubt the Queen will continue to allow me to serve in the Senate, and if the Council discovers you are the father, you will be expelled from the Jedi Order. \n\nANAKIN: I know �. \n\nPADME: Anakin, do you think Obi-Wan might be able to help us? \n\nANAKIN: (suspicious) Have you told him anything? \n\nPADME: No, but he's your mentor, your best friend . . . he must suspect something. \n\nANAKIN: He's been a father to me, but he's still on the Council. Don't tell him anything! \n\nPADME: I won't, Anakin. \n\nANAKIN: I don't need his help . . . Our baby is a blessing, not a problem. \n\n77",

That's unusual, isn't it? \n\nOBI-WAN: All of this is unusual, and it's making me feel uneasy. You're probably aware that relations between the Council and the Chancellor are stressed. \n\nANAKIN: I know the Council has grown wary of the Chancellor's power, mine also for that matter. Aren't we all working together to save the Republic? Why all this distrust? \n\nOBI-WAN: The Force grows dark, Anakin, and we are all affected by it. Be wary of your feelings. \n\n80",

The Senate is too unfocused to conduct a war. This will bring a quick end to things. \n\nANAKIN: I agree, but the Jedi Council may not see it that way. \n\nPALPATINE: There are times when we must all endure adjustments to the constitution in the name of security. \n\nANAKIN: With all due respect, sir, the Council is in no mood for more constitutional amendments. \n\nPALPATINE: Thank you, my friend, but in this case I have no choice . . . this war must be won. \n\nANAKIN: Everyone will agree on that. \n\nPALPATINE: Anakin, I've known you since you were a small boy. I have advised you over the years when I could ... I am very proud of your accomplishments. You have won many battles the Jedi Council thought were lost . . . and you saved my life. I hope you trust me, Anakin. \n\nANAKIN: Of course. \n\nPALPATINE: I need your help, son. \n\nANAKIN: What do you mean? \n\nPALPATINE: I fear the Jedi. The Council keeps pushing for more control. They're shrouded in secrecy and obsessed with maintaining their autonomy . . . ideals. I find simply incomprehensible in a democracy. \n\nANAKIN: I can assure you that the Jedi are dedicated to the values of the Republic, sir. \n\nPALPATINE: Nevertheless, their actions will speak more loudly than their words.

They know where the power lies, and they will do whatever it takes to share in it. Palpatine has become a dictator and we have helped him to do it. \n\nBAIL ORGANA: We can't sit around debating any longer, we have decided to do what we can to stop it.

How can you do this?? This is outrageous, it's unfair . . . I'm more powerful than any of you.

The outlying systems, you must sweep. \n\nOBI-WAN: It may take some time . . . we do not have many ships to spare. \n\nMACE: We cannot take ships from the front line. \n\nOBI-WAN: And yet, it would be fatal for us to allow the droid armies to regroup. \n\nYODA: Master Kenobi, our spies contact, you must, and then wait. \n\nKl-ADI-MUNDI: What about the droid attack on the Wookiees? \n\nMACE: It is critical we send an attack group there, immediately! \n\nOBI-WAN: He's right, that is a system we cannot afford to lose. It's the main navigation route for the southwestern quadrant. \n\nANAKIN: I know that system well.

It's insulting! \n\nOBI-WAN: Calm down, Anakin. You have been given a great honor. To be on the Council at your age . . . It's never happened before. Listen to me, Anakin. The fact of the matter is you're too close to the Chancellor. The Council doesn't like it when he interferes in Jedi affairs. \n\nANAKIN: I swear to you, I didn't ask to be put on the Council . . . \n\nOBI-WAN: But it's what you wanted!

I was very clear. Why didn't you listen? You walked right into it. \n\nANAKIN: The Council is upset I'm the youngest to ever serve. \n\nOBI-WAN: No, it is not. Anakin, I worry when you speak of jealousy and pride. Those are not Jedi thoughts. They're dangerous, dark thoughts. \n\nANAKIN: Master, you of all people should have confidence in my abilities. I know where my loyalties lie. \n\nOBI-WAN: I hope so . . . \n\nANAKIN: I sense there's more to this talk than you're saying. \n\nOBI-WAN: Anakin, the only reason the Council has approved your appointment is because the Chancellor trusts you. \n\nANAKIN: And? \n\nOBI-WAN: Anakin, look, I am on your side. I didn't want to see you put in this situation. \n\nANAKIN: What situation? \n\nOBI-WAN: (takes a deep breath) The Council wants you to report on all of the Chancellor's dealings. They want to know what he's up to. \n\nANAKIN: They want me to spy on the Chancellor? That's treason! \n\nOBI-WAN: We are at war, Anakin.

He's watched out for me ever since I arrived here. \n\nOBI-WAN: That is why you must help us, Anakin. Our allegiance is to the Senate, not to its leader who has managed to stay in office long after his term has expired. \n\nANAKIN: Master, the Senate demanded that he stay longer. \n\nOBI-WAN: Yes, but use your feelings, Anakin. Something is out of place. \n\nANAKIN: You're asking me to do something against the Jedi Code. Against the Republic. Against a mentor . . . and a friend. That's what's out of place here.
