In the box, POGGLE THE LESSER rises. The crowd becomes quiet.\n\n\t\t\t\tPOGGLE\n\t\t\tLet the executions begin!\n\nThe crowd goes wild.\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tI have a bad feeling about this.\n\nFrom different gates around the arena, THREE MONSTERS are driven in. One is a REEK (bull-like), one is a NEXU (lion-like), and one is an ACKLAY (a kind of dino-lobster). They are driven in by PICADORS carrying long spears and riding ORRAYS. The PICADORS poke the MONSTERS toward the center, then retire to the perimeter.\n\nThe MONSTERS toss their heads, looking around, ROARING or SCREECHING. Then they catch sight of the THREE CAPTIVES and start moving toward them.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tTake the one the left. I'll\n\t\t\ttake the one on the right.\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tWhat about Padme?\n\nPADME has turned around and is pulling herself up by the chain to the top of the post. Within a moment, she is standing on top of it, trying to pull the chain free.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tIt looks like she's already on top\n\t\t\tof things.\n\nThe REEK charges ANAKIN. He jumps up, and the beast hits the post hard. ANAKIN lands onto its back, wrapping part of his chain around its horn. The REEK backs off, shaking its head angrily, which tears the chain from the post\n\nOBI-WAN ducks around the post as the ACKLAY charges. It knocks the post flat, sending OBI-WAN sprawling. The ACKLAY crunches the post between its claws, freeing the chain. OBI-WAN leaps up and runs towards ONE of the PICADORS. The ACKLAY taks off after him.\n\nThe NEXU arrives at PADME'S post and rears on its hind legs. One top, PADME struggles to tear the chain free. The NEXU ROARS, displaying wicked, dripping fangs.\n\nIn the archducal box, NUTE GUNRAY beams and rubs his hands.\n\nIn the arena, OBI-WAN runs at the PICADOR. The ORRAY rears up. OBI-WAN grabs the PICADOR'S long spear and pole vaults over him. The chasing ACKLAY smashes into the ORRAY. It goes down. The PICADOR tumbles onto the sand, where he is grabbed by the ACKLAY and crunched.\n\nANAKIN's REEK starts to buck. It charges around the arena with ANAKIN hanging on for dear life. He whirls the free length of chain around his head and casts it into the REEK's mouth. Its jaws clamp hard on the chain. ANAKIN yanks hard on the chain, turning the REEK, beginning to ride it.\n\nThe NEXU's claws dig deep into the post. The cat-like creature reaches the top of the post and takes a swipe at PADME. She turns and the claw barely catches her shirt ripping it off, leaving superficial claw marks across her back. She hits the creature with her chain and it backs off down the pole. Then, PADME jumps off the post into the air. She swings around on the chain and whacks the beast hard on the head with both her feet. It tumbles back onto the sand.\n\nIn the archducal box:\n\n\t\t\t\tNUTE GUNRAY\n\t\t\tFoul!! She can't do that... shoot\n\t\t\ther or something!\n\nIn the arena, OBI-WAN runs out from behind the fallen ORRAY and throws the spear at the ACKLAY, hitting it in the neck. It lets out a terrible SCREECH and turns on him. The NEXU springs up and makes to leap up at PADME again. She finally manages to work the chain loose. ANAKIN comes charging up on the REEK.\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tYou okay?\n\n\t\t\t\tPADME\n\t\t\t\t(nods, gasping)\n\t\t\tSure! Well, sort of.\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tJump!!!\n\nThe NEXU springs. PADME leaps from the top of the post to land on the REEK in front of ANAKIN. He hauls her upright. The REEK charges away, around the arena. The NEXU bounds after it. The REEK passes the wounded ACKLAY. The NEXU smells the blood and turns aside to attack the ACKLAY. The TWO MONSTERS fight. The crowd GROANS and BOOS.\n\nIn the archducal box, NUTE GUNRAY turns angrily to COUNT DOOKU.\n\n\t\t\t\tNUTE GUNRAY\n\t\t\tThis isn't how it's supposed to\n\t\t\tbe! Jango, finish her off.\n\nCOUNT DOOKU motions for the bounty hunter to ptay put.
