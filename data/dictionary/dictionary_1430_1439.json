Too much pride in his powers. \n\nMACE: It's very dangerous, putting them together. I don't think the boy can handle it. I don't trust him. \n\nOBI-WAN: He'll be all right.

He never has. \n\nYODA: I hope right you are. And now destroy the Droid armies on Kashyyyk, I will. May the Force be with you. \n\nThe GUNSHIP lands and the ramp lowers. YODA exits the GUNSHIP.

PADME turns to CAPTAIN TYPHO. \n\nPADME: Thank you, Captain. \n\nCAPTAIN TYPHO: Rest well. My Lady. \n\nCAPTAIN TYPHO gets back into the Speeder, and it disappears into the cityscape. The HANDMAIDENS, Motee and Elle, approach PADME as the SHADOW OF A FIGURE moves in the background. C-3PO is standing nearby. \n\nPADME: I'll be up in a while. \n\nMOTEE: Yes, my lady. \n\nC-3PO stands, confused, as the HANDMAIDENS turn and exit. \n\nC-3PO: Is there anything I might do for you, my lady? \n\nPADME: Yes, make sure all the security droids are working. Thank you, Threepio. \n\nThe golden droid turns and exits. \n\nPADME stands and watches the sunset. The SHADOWY FIGURE moves toward her. She senses something. \n\nANAKIN: Beautiful, isn't it? \n\nPADME jumps and turns around. \n\nPADME: You startled me. \n\nHe sits next to her on the bench. \n\nANAKIN: How are you feeling? \n\nPADME: He keeps kicking. \n\nANAKIN: He?! Why do you think it's a boy? \n\nPADME: (laughs) My motherly intuition. \n\nShe puts his hand on her belly. \n\nANAKIN: Whoa! With a kick that strong, it's got to be a girl. \n\nThey laugh. \n\nPADME: I heard about your appointment. Anakin. I'm so proud of you. \n\nANAKIN: I may be on the Council, but . . . they refused to accept me as a Jedi Master. \n\nPADME: Patience. In time, they will recognize your skills. \n\nANAKIN: They still treat me as if I were a Padawan learner. . . they fear my power, that's the problem. \n\nPADME: Anakin . . . \n\nANAKIN: Sometimes, I wonder what's happening to the Jedi Order . . . I think this war is destroying the principles of the Republic. \n\nPADME: Have you ever considered that we may be on the wrong side? \n\nANAKIN: (suspicious) What do you mean? \n\nPADME: What if the democracy we thought we were serving no longer exists, and the Republic has become the very evil we have been fighting to destroy? \n\nANAKIN: I don't believe that. And you're sounding like a Separatist! \n\nPADME: Anakin, this war represents a failure to listen . . . Now, you're closer to the Chancellor than anyone. Please, please ask him to stop the fighting and let diplomacy resume. \n\nANAKIN: (growing angry) Don't ask me to do that, Padme. Make a motion in the Senate, where that kind of a request belongs. I'm not your errand boy. I'm not anyone's errand boy! \n\nPADME: What is it? \n\nANAKIN: Nothing. \n\nPADME: Don't do this . . . don't shut me out. Let me help you. \n\nANAKIN: You can't help me . . . I'm trying to help you. \n\nThey look in each other's eyes. \n\nANAKIN: (continuing) I sense . . . there are things you are not telling me. \n\nPADME is startled at this. \n\nPADME: I sense there are things you are not telling me. \n\nPADME smiles. ANAKIN is a little embarrassed. \n\nPADME: (continuing) Hold me . . . like you did by the lake on Naboo, so long ago . . . when there was nothing but our love ... No politics, no plotting ... no war. \n\n88",

        "passage": "ANAKIN lands his speeder and exits. \nANAKIN runs up the stairs at the Galaxies Opera House. \nANAKIN runs through the hallway and enters Palpatine's box, where the CHANCELLOR is sitting with Mas Amedda and Sly-Moore, watching the Man Calamari Ballet doing \"Squid Lake.\" \n\nANAKIN: You wanted to see me, Chancellor. \n\nPALPATINE: Yes, Anakin! Come closer. I have good news. Our Clone Intelligence Units have discovered the location of General Grievous. He is hiding in the Utapau system. \n\nANAKIN: At last, we'll be able to capture that monster and end this war. \n\nPALPATINE: I would worry about the collective wisdom of the Council if they didn't select you for this assignment. You are the best choice by far ï¿½ but, they can't always be trusted to do the right thing. \n\nANAKIN: They try. \n\nPALPATINE: Sit down, (to his aides) Leave us. \n\nANAKIN sits next to PALPATINE. The Chancellor leans over to him. \n\nPALPATINE: (continuing) Anakin, you know I'm not able to rely on the Jedi Council. If they haven't included you in their plot, they soon will. \n\nANAKIN: I'm not sure I understand. \n\nPALPATINE: You must sense what I have come to suspect . . . the Jedi Council want control of the Republic . . . they're planning to betray me. \n\nANAKIN: I don't think . . . \n\nPALPATINE: Anakin, search your feelings. You know, don't you? \n\nANAKIN: I know they don't trust you . . . \n\nPALPATINE: Or the Senate . . . or the Republic . . . or democracy for that matter. \n\nANAKIN: I have to admit my trust in them has been shaken. \n\nPALPATINE: Why? They asked you to do something that made you feel dishonest, didn't they? \n\nANAKIN doesn't say anything. He simply looks down. \n\nPALPATINE: (continuing) They asked you to spy on me, didn't they? \n\nANAKIN: I don't know ... I don't know what to say. \n\nPALPATINE: Remember back to your early teachings. Anakin. \"All those who gain power are afraid to lose it.\" Even the Jedi. \n\nANAKIN: The Jedi use their power for good. \n\nPALPATINE: Good is a point of view, Anakin. And the Jedi point of view is not the only valid one. The Dark Lords of the Sith believe in security and justice also, yet they are considered by the Jedi to be. . . \n\nANAKIN: . . . evil. \n\nPALPATINE: . . . from a Jedi's point of view. The Sith and the Jedi are similar in almost every way, including their quest for greater power. The difference between the two is the Sith are not afraid of the dark side of the Force. That is why they are more powerful. \n\nANAKIN: The Sith rely on their passion for their strength. They think inward, only about themselves. \n\nPALPATINE: And the Jedi don't? \n\nANAKIN: The Jedi are selfless . . . they only care about others. \n\nPALPATINE smiles. \n\nPALPATINE: Or so you've been trained to believe. Why is it, then, that they have asked you to do something you feel is wrong? \n\nANAKIN: I'm not sure it's wrong. \n\nPALPATINE: Have they asked you to betray the Jedi code? The Constitution? A friendship? Your own values? Think. Consider their motives. Keep your mind clear of assumptions. The fear of losing power is a weakness of both the Jedi and the Sith. \n\nANAKIN is deep in thought. \n\nPALPATINE: (continuing) Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis \"the wise\"? \n\nANAKIN: No. \n\nPALPATINE: I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midi-chlorians to create life ... He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. \n\nANAKIN: He could actually save people from death? \n\nPALPATINE: The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. \n\nANAKIN: What happened to him? \n\nPALPATINE: He became so powerful . . . the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. (smiles) Plagueis never saw it coming. It's ironic he could save others from death, but not himself. \n\nANAKIN: Is it possible to learn this power? \n\nPALPATINE: Not from a Jedi. \n\n89",
