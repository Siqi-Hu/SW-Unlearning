He then\n     hugs Malla. They are interrupted by a knock at the door.\n     Chewie grabs his bowcaster and opens the door. Saundan \n     enters the home to a bowcaster aimed at him.\n \n                            SAUNDAN\n                    (to Chewie)\n               You sure know how to make a guy feel \n               welcome. \n\n     Chewie lowers his weapon and shakes Saundan's hand.\n\n                            SAUNDAN\n               Glad you're home, Chewbacca. \n\n     Lumpy runs up to the closed door and tries to look outside.\n\n                            SAUNDAN\n                    (to Lumpy)\n               If you're looking for who I'm thinking \n               you're looking for, forget him. We won't \n               be bothered by him again.\n\n     The wall screen goes on and an Imperial officer appears.\n     Saundan and the wookiees watch in silence.\n\n                            IMPERIAL OFFICER\n                    (on monitor)\n               This is a general alert. Calling officer \n               B-4711, officer B-4711. We are unable to \n               reach you on your comlink. Is there a \n               problem? You are instructed to turn on \n               your comlink immediately.\n\n     The wookiees are disturbed by the announcement.\n\n                            SAUNDAN\n               Wait, wait a minute. I think I can handle \n               this.\n\n     Saundan pulls out his identification card and inserts it \n     into the wall screen's controls. He pushes some buttons \n     and the screen comes to life. The Imperial officer is \n     again on the screen.\n\n                            IMPERIAL OFFICER\n               We have two-way communication, trader \n               Saundan. Is this a report about the \n               missing trooper?\n\n                            SAUNDAN\n                    (to officer)\n               It is, sir. Trooper B-4711 was here with \n               three other men. They left and he \n               remained. As soon as they had gone, he \n               packed a lot of food from this house and \n               robbed me blind. Then, he took off for \n               the hills.\n\n                            IMPERIAL OFFICER\n                    (taking a deep breath)\n               Very well. We'll send out a search party.\n\n                            SAUNDAN\n               Thank you.\n\n     The call ends. Saundan pushes some buttons and removes his\n     card. He puts it back into his leather case.\n\n                            SAUNDAN\n               Yes, sir. Identification is very important. \n               Helps you maintain contact with the Empire \n               at times like this. \n\n     The wookiees growl at him. Chewbacca shakes his hand.\n\n                            SAUNDAN\n               Lumpy. Itchy. Chewie. Malla. This day is \n               for you. Have a wonderful celebration. \n\n     Lumpy goes to Saundan and hugs his leg.\n\n                            SAUNDAN\n               And may the force be with you.\n\n     Saundan turns and leaves the wookiee home. The wookiees \n     all go to a shelf and get glass globes that have \n     something gold in them. The lights dim in the room as the\n     wookiees gather together. They are lit by an increasingly\n     bright shimmering light. They raise the globes into the \n     air.\n\n76.",

Curving plumes of snow rise from beneath the\n    speeding paws of the two-legged beast.\n\n    The rider gallops up a slope and reins his lizard to a stop.\n    Pulling off his protective goggles, Luke Skywalker notices\n    something in the sky. He takes a pair of electrobinoculars\n    from his utility belt and through them sees smoke rising\n    from where the probe robot has crashed.\n\n    The wind whips at Luke's fur-lined cap and he activates a\n    comlink transmitter. His Tauntaun shifts and moans\n    nervously beneath him.\n\n                        LUKE\n                  (into comlink)\n              Echo Three to Echo Seven.

It won't take long.\n\n    Luke clicks off his transmitter and reins back on his\n    nervous lizard. He pats the beast on the head to calm it.\n\n                        LUKE (CONT’D)\n              Hey, steady girl. What's the\n              matter? You smell something?\n\n    Luke takes a small device from his belt and starts to adjust\n    it when suddenly a large shadow falls over him from behind.\n    He hears a monstrous howl and turns to see an eleven-foot-\n    tall shape towering over him. It is a Wampa Ice Creature,\n    lunging at him ferociously.\n\n                        LUKE (CONT’D)\n              Aaargh!\n\n    Luke grabs for his pistol, but is hit flat in the face by a\n    huge white claw. He falls unconscious into the snow and in\n    a moment the terrified screams of the Tauntaun are cut short\n    by the horrible snap of a neck being broken.\n\n    The Wampa Ice Creature grabs Luke by one ankle and drags him\n    away across the frozen plain.\n\n4",
