He\n      stands on his hands, with Yoda perched on his feet.\n\nOpposite Luke and Yoda are two rocks the size of bowling\nballs. Luke stares at the rocks and concentrates.

But, distracted by\nArtoo's frantic beeping, Luke loses his balance and finally\ncollapses. Yoda jumps clear.\n\n                    YODA (CONT’D)\n          Concentrate!\n\nAnnoyed at the disturbance, Luke looks over at Artoo, who is\nrocking urgently back and forth in front of him.\n\nArtoo waddles closer to Luke, chirping wildly, then scoots\nover the edge of the swamp. Catching on, Luke rushes to the\nwater's edge. The X-wing fighter has sunk, and only the tip\nof its nose shows above the lake's surface.\n\n                     LUKE\n          Oh, no.

Try not. Do.    Or do not.\n          There is no try.\n\nLuke closes his eyes and concentrates on thinking the ship\nout.\n\nSlowly, the X-wing's nose begins to rise above the water.\nIt hovers for a moment and then slides back, disappearing\nonce again.\n\n                    LUKE\n              (panting heavily)\n          I can't.

With his eyes\nclosed and his head bowed, he raises his arm and points at\nthe ship.\n\nSoon, the fighter rises above the water and moves forward as\nArtoo beeps in terror and scoots away.\n\n      The entire X-wing moves majestically, surely, toward the\n      shore. Yoda stands on a tree root and guides the fighter\n      carefully down toward the beach.\n\n      Luke stares in astonishment as the fighter settles down onto\n      the shore.
