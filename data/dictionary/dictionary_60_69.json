He turns a\nlittle brighter red.\n\nSHMI : All slaves have transmitters placed inside their bodies somewhere.\nANAKIN : I've been working on a scanner to try and locate them, but no\nluck.\nSHMI : Any attempt to escape...\nANAKIN : ...and they blow you up...poof!\n\nPADME and JAR JAR are horrified.\n\nJAR JAR : How wude.\nPADME : I can't believe there is still slavery in the galaxy. The\nRepublic's anti-slavery laws...\nSHMI : The Republic doesn't exist out here...we must survive on our own.\n\nAn awkward silence. ANAKIN attempts to end the embarrassment.\n\nANAKIN : Have you ever seen a Podrace?\n\nPADME shakes her head no. She notices the concern of SHMI. JAR JAR snatches\nsome food from a bowl at the other end of the table with his tongue.\nQUI-GON gives him a dirty look.\n\nQUI-GON : They have Podracing on Malastare. Very fast, very dangerous.\nANAKIN : I'm the only human who can do it.\n\nSHMI looks askance at her son.\n\nANAKIN : (Cont'd) Mom, what? I'm not bragging. It's true. Watto says he's\nnever heard of a human doing it.\nQUI-GON : You must have Jedi reflexes if you race Pods.\n\nANAKIN smiles. JAR JAR attempts to snare another bit of food from the bowl\nwith his tongue, but QUI-GON, in a flash, grabs it between his thumb and\nforefinger. JAR JAR is startled.\n\nQUI-GON : (Cont'd) Don't do that again.\n\nJAR JAR tries to acknowledge with some silly mumbling. QUI-GON lets go of\nthe tongue, and it snaps back into JAR JAR's mouth.\n\nANAKIN : I...I was wondering...something...\nQUI-GON : What?\nANAKIN : Well, ahhh...you're a Jedi Knight, aren't you?\nQUI-GON : What makes you think that?\nANAKIN : I saw your laser sword. Only Jedi carry that kind of weapon.\n\nQUI-GON leans back and slowly smiles.\n\nQUI-GON : Perhaps I killed a Jedi and stole it from him.\nANAKIN : I don't think so... No one can kill a Jedi Knight.\nQUI-GON : I wish that were so...\nANAKIN. I had a dream I was a Jedi. I came back here and freed all the\nslaves...have you come to free us?\nQUI-GON : No, I'm afraid not...\nANAKIN : I think you have...why else would you be here?\n\nQUI-GON thinks for a moment.\n\nQUI-GON : I can see there's no fooling you...(leans forward) You mustn't\nlet anyone know about us...we're on our way to Coruscant, the central\nsystem in the Republic, on a very important mission, and it must be kept\nsecret.\nANAKIN : Coruscant...wow...how did you end up here in the outer rim?\nPADME : Our ship was damaged, and we're stranded here until we can repair\nit.\nANAKIN : I can help! I can fix anything!\nQUI-GON : I believe you can, but our first job is to aquire the parts we\nneed...\nJAR JAR : Wit no-nutten mula to trade.\nPADME : These junk dealers must have a weakness of some kind.\nSHMI : Gambling. Everything here revolves around betting on those awful\nraces.\nQUI-GON : Podracing... Greed can be a powerful ally.. if it's used\nproperly.\nANAKIN : I've built a racer! It's the fastest ever...There's a big race\ntomorrow, on Boonta Eve. You could enter my pod. It's all but finished...\nSHMI : Anakin, settle down. Watto won't let you...\nANAKIN : Watto doesn't know I've built it. (to Qui-Gon) You could make him\nthink it's your's, and you could get him to let me pilot it for you.\n\nQUI-GON looks to SHMI. She is upset.\n\nSHMI : I don't want you to race, Annie...It's awful. I die every time Watto\nmakes you do it.\n\nANAKIN : But Mom, I love it...and they need help...they're in trouble. The\nprize money would more than pay for the parts they need. JAR JAR : Wesa ina\npitty bad goo.\nGUI-GON : Your mother's right. Is there anyone friendly to the Republic who\nmight be able to help us?\n\nSHMI shakes her head no.\n\nANAKIN : We have to help them, Mom...you said that the biggest problem in\nthe universe is no one helps each other...\nSHMI : Anakin, don't...\n\nJAR JAR belches. There is silence for a moment as they eat.\n\nPADME : I'm sure Qui-Gon doesn't want to put your son in danger. We will\nfind another way...\nSHMI : No, Annie's right, there is no other way...
