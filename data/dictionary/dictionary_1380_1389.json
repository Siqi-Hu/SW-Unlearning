        "passage": "The elevator door opens and the TWO JEDI carefully make their way into the main room of the General's Quarters. \nAt the far end sits SUPREME CHANCELLOR PALPATINE. ANAKIN and OBI-WAN move toward the CHANCELLOR. \nAs they get closer to PALPATINE, they see a very distressed look on the Chancellor's face. \n\nOBI-WAN: (bows) Chancellor. \n\nANAKIN: Are you all right? \n\nPALPATINE: (quietly) Count Dooku. \n\nPALPATINE makes a small gesture with his hand. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN turn around. The elevator DOORS CAN BE HEARD OPENING AND CLOSING as COUNT DOOKU strides into the room. He is above the Jedi, standing on a balcony, with two SUPER BATTLE DROIDS. The Jedi turn to see him. He looks down on the Jedi. \n\nOBI-WAN: (quietly to Anakin) This time we will do it together. \n\nANAKIN: I was about to say that. \n\nCOUNT DOOKU jumps down to the main level. \n\nPALPATINE: Get help! You're no match for him. He's a Sith Lord. \n\nOBI-WAN: Chancellor Palpatine, Sith Lords are our specialty. \n\nOBI-WAN and ANAKIN throw off their cloaks and ignite their lightsabers. \n\nCOUNT DOOKU: Your swords, please, Master Jedi. We don't want to make a mess of things in front of the Chancellor. \n\nOBI-WAN and ANAKIN move toward DOOKU. \n\nOBI-WAN: You won't get away this time, Dooku. \n\nOBI-WAN and ANAKIN charge COUNT DOOKU. A great sword fight ensues. \n\nCOUNT DOOKU: I've been looking forward to this. \n\nANAKIN: My powers have doubled since the last time we met, Count. \n\nCOUNT DOOKU: Good. Twice the pride, double the fall. \n\nDOOKU lunges at the JEDI and they fall back . . . \n\nCOUNT DOOKU: (continuing) Your moves are clumsy, Kenobi . . . too predictable. You'll have to do better. \n\nAs the battle proceeds, OBI-WAN and COUNT DOOKU are tired. ANAKIN is stronger as he becomes angry. ANAKIN continues to drive the attack on DOOKU. COUNT DOOKU throws OBI-WAN back using the Force. \nANAKIN and COUNT DOOKU move up the stairs. As they reach the upper landing of the General's Quarters, ANAKIN leaps over COUNT DOOKU. OBI-WAN reaches the top of the stairs, destroying TWO SUPER BATTLE DROIDS. COUNT DOOKU holds OBI-WAN in the air using the Force as he turns and kicks ANAKIN out of frame. OBI-WAN is choking. \nANAKIN hits the archway. \nDOOKU sends OBI-WAN flying. The Jedi tumbles to the lower level unconscious. COUNT DOOKU spins around again and, using the Force, causes a section of the balcony to drop onto OBI-WAN. ANAKIN spins and kicks COUNT DOOKU, sending him over the balcony. ANAKIN Jumps, following him down to the main floor. COUNT DOOKU and ANAKIN continue the fight. \n\nCOUNT DOOKU: (continuing) I sense great fear in you, Skywalker. You have hate, you have anger, but you donï¿½t use them. \n\nAnakin regains his composure and attacks COUNT DOOKU as the Dark Lord continues his spin to meet him head on. Their fighting becomes even more intense. \nAnakin attacks COUNT DOOKU with a new ferociousness. \n\n39",

The Jedi catches the lightsaber as it drops from the severed Sith Lord's hand. COUNT DOOKU stumbles to the floor as ANAKIN puts the two lightsabers to his neck. PALPATINE is grinning as he watches COUNT DOOKU's defeat. \n\nPALPATINE: Good, Anakin, good. I knew you could do it. Kill him. Kill him now! \n\nANAKIN: I shouldn't . . . \n\nPALPATINE: Do it!! \n\nANAKIN cuts off COUNT DOOKU's head. A huge EXPLOSION somewhere deep in the ship rattles everything. \n\nANAKIN: ... I couldn't stop myself. \n\nPALPATINE: You did well, Anakin. He was too dangerous to be kept alive. \n\nANAKIN drops COUNT DOOKU's lightsaber, moving to PALPATINE. \n\nANAKIN: Yes, but he was an unarmed prisoner. \n\nANAKIN raises his hands toward PALPATINE, who is strapped in the Admiral's Chair. The Chancellor's restraints pop loose. \n\nANAKIN: (continuing) I shouldn't have done that, Chancellor. It's not the Jedi way. \n\nPALPATINE stands up, rubbing his wrists. \n\nPALPATINE: It is only natural. He cut off your arm, and you wanted revenge. It wasn't the first time, Anakin. Remember what you told me about your mother and the Sand People. Now, we must leave before more security droids arrive. \n\nThe ship begins to list to one side. ANAKIN rushes over to OBI-WAN, lifts the control console from on top of him, and pulls him free. He kneels down and checks out his unconscious friend. PALPATINE heads for the elevators. \n\nPALPATINE: (continuing) Anakin, there is no time. We must get off the ship before it's too late. \n\nANAKIN: He seems to be all right. No broken bones, breathing's all right. \n\nPALPATINE: Leave him, or we'll never make it. \n\nANAKIN: His fate will be the same as ours. \n\nANAKIN picks up OBI-WAN, slings him over his shoulder, and heads for the elevators. \n\n40",
