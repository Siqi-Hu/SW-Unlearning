I fear\n               something terrible has happened.\n\n     Ben rubs his forehead. He seems to drift into a trance.

A sudden frown crosses\nChewbacca's face and he begins yelling gibberish at the tiny\nrobot. Threepio intercedes on behalf of his small companion\nand begins to argue with the huge Wookiee.\n\n                    THREEPIO (CONT’D)\n          He made a fair move.

Let the\n          Wookiee win.\n\nLuke stands in the middle of the small hold area; he seems\nfrozen in place. A humming lightsaber is held high over his\nhead. Ben watches him from the corner, studying his\nmovements. Han watches with a bit of smugness.\n\n                    BEN\n          Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force\n          flowing through him.\n\n                    LUKE\n          You mean it controls your actions?\n\n                    BEN\n          Partially. But it also obeys your\n          commands.\n\nSuspended at eye level, about ten feet in front of Luke, a\n\"seeker\", a chrome baseball-like robot covered with\nantennae, hovers slowly in a wide arc. The ball floats to\none side of the youth then the other. Suddenly it makes a\nlightning-swift lunge and stops within a few feet of Luke's\nface. Luke doesn't move and the ball backs off. It slowly\nmoves behind the boy, then makes another quick lunge, this\ntime emitting a blood red laser beam as it attacks. It hits\nLuke in the leg causing him to tumble over. Han lets loose\nwith a burst of laughter.\n\n                    HAN\n          Hokey religions and ancient weapons\n          are no match for a good blaster at\n          your side, kid.\n\n                    LUKE\n          You don't believe in the Force, do\n          you?\n\n                    HAN\n          Kid, I've flown from one side of\n          this galaxy to the other. I've seen\n          a lot of strange stuff, but I've\n          never seen anything to make me\n          believe there's one all-powerful\n          force controlling everything.\n          There's no mystical energy field\n          that controls my destiny.\n\nBen smiles quietly.\n\n                    HAN (CONT’D)\n          It's all a lot of simple tricks and\n          nonsense.\n\n                    BEN\n          I suggest you try it again, Luke.\n\nBen places a large helmet on Luke's head which covers his\neyes.\n\n                    BEN (CONT’D)\n          This time, let go your conscious\n          self and act on instinct.\n\n                    LUKE\n              (laughing)\n          With the blast shield down, I can't\n          even see. How am I supposed to\n          fight?\n\n                    BEN\n          Your eyes can deceive you. Don't\n          trust them.\n\nHan skeptically shakes his head as Ben throws the seeker\ninto the air. The ball shoots straight up in the air, then\ndrops like a rock. Luke swings the lightsaber around blindly\nmissing the seeker, which fires off a laserbolt which hits\nLuke square on the seat of the pants. He lets out a painful\nyell and attempts to hit the seeker.\n\n                    BEN (CONT’D)\n          Stretch out with your feelings.\n\nLuke stands in one place, seemingly frozen. The seeker makes\na dive at Luke and, incredibly, he managed to deflect the\nbolt. The ball ceases fire and moves back to its original\nposition.\n\n                    BEN (CONT’D)\n          You see, you can do it.\n\n                    HAN\n          I call it luck.\n\n                    BEN\n          In my experience, there's no such\n          thing as luck.\n\n                    HAN\n          Look, going good against remotes is\n          one thing. Going good against the\n          living? That's something else.\n\n     Solo notices a small light flashing on the far side of the\n     control panel.\n\n                         HAN (CONT’D)\n               Looks like we're coming up on\n               Alderaan.\n\n     Han and Chewbacca head back to the cockpit.\n\n                         LUKE\n               You know, I did feel something. I\n               could almost see the remote.\n\n                         BEN\n               That's good. You have taken your\n               first step into a larger world.\n\n87",
