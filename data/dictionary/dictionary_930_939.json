MAS AMEDDA, the Supreme Chancellor's majordomo, tries to quiet things down as PALPATINE confers with an AIDE, UV GIZEN, riding a small one man floating scooter.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAS AMEDDA\n\t\t\tOrder! We shall have order! The motion\n\t\t\tfor the Republic to commission an army\n\t\t\ttakes precedent, and that is what we\n\t\t\twill vote on at this time.\n\nEverything quiets down. The AIDE disperses, and SUPREME CHANCELLOR PALPATINE steps to the podium.\n\n\t\t\t\tPALPATINE\n\t\t\t...My esteemed colleagues, excuse\n\t\t\tme... I have just received some\n\t\t\ttragic and disturbing news. Senator\n\t\t\tAmidala of the Naboo system... Has\n\t\t\tbeen assassinated!\n\nThere is a shock silence in the vast arena.\n\n\t\t\t\tPALPATINE\n\t\t\t\t(continued)\n\t\t\tThis grievous blow is especially\n\t\t\tpersonal to me. Before I became\n\t\t\tChancellor, I served Amidala when\n\t\t\tshe was Queen. She was a great\n\t\t\tleader who fought for justice, not\n\t\t\tonly in this honourable assembly,\n\t\t\tbut also on her home planet. She\n\t\t\twas so loved she could have been\n\t\t\telected queen for life. She\n\t\t\tbelieved in public service, and\n\t\t\tshe fervently believed in\n\t\t\tdemocracy. Her death is a great\n\t\t\tloss to us all. We will all mourn\n\t\t\ther as a relentless champion of\n\t\t\tfreedom... and as a dear friend.\n\nThere is a moment of silence. ASK AAK, the SENATOR of MALASTARE, moves his pod into the centre of the arena.\n\n\t\t\t\tSENATOR ASK AAK\n\t\t\tHow many more Senators will die\n\t\t\tbefore this civil strife ends! We\n\t\t\tmust confront these rebels now,\n\t\t\tand they need an army to do it.\n\nA second pod moves into the centre of the area with DARSANA, the \nAMBASSADOR OF GLEE ANSELM.\n\n\t\t\t\tAMBASSADOR DARSANA\n\t\t\tWhy weren't the Jedi able to stop\n\t\t\tthis assassination? We are no\n\t\t\tlonger safe, under their protection.\n\nSenator ORN FREE TAA swings forward in his pod.\n\n\t\t\t\tORN FREE TAA\n\t\t\tThe Republic needs more security\n\t\t\tnow! Before it comes to war.\n\n\t\t\t\tPALPATINE\n\t\t\tMust I remind the Senator from\n\t\t\tMalastare that negotiations are\n\t\t\tcontinuing with the separatists.\n\t\t\tPeace is our objective here... not\n\t\t\twar.\n\nThe SENATORS yell pro and con. MAS AMEDDA tries to calm things down. SENATOR PADME AMIDALA, with CAPTAIN TYPHO, JAR JAR, and DORME, manoeuvre her pod into the centre of the vast arena.\n\n\t\t\t\tAMIDALA\n\t\t\tMy noble colleagues, I concur with\n\t\t\tthe Supreme Chancellor. At all\n\t\t\tcosts, we do not want war!\n\nThe Senate goes quiet, then there is an outburst of cheering and \napplause.\n\n\t\t\t\tPALPATINE\n\t\t\tIt is with great surprise and\n\t\t\tjoy the chair recognises the\n\t\t\tSenator from Naboo, Padm� Amidala.\n\n\t\t\t\tPADM�\n\t\t\tLess than an hour ago, an\n\t\t\tassassination attempt was made\n\t\t\tagainst my life. One of my\n\t\t\tbodyguards and six  others were\n\t\t\truthlessly and senselessly\n\t\t\tmurdered. I was the target but,\n\t\t\tmore importantly, I believe this\n\t\t\tsecurity measure before you, was\n\t\t\tthe target. I have led the\n\t\t\topposition to build an army... but\n\t\t\tthere is someone in this body who\n\t\t\twill stop at nothing to assure it's\n\t\t\tpassage...\n\nMany of the SENATORS boo and yell at SENATOR AMIDALA.\n\n\t\t\t\tPADM�\n\t\t\t \t(continuing)\n\t\t\tI warn you, if you vote to create\n\t\t\tthis army, war will follow. I\n\t\t\thave experienced the misery of war \n\t\t\tfirst-hand; I do not wish to do it\n\t\t\tagain.\n\nThere is sporadic yelling for and against her statements.\n\n\t\t\t\tPADM�\n\t\t\tWake up, Senators... you must wake\n\t\t\tup! If you offer the separatists\n\t\t\tviolence, they can only show us\n\t\t\tviolence in return! Many will\n\t\t\tlose their lives. All will lose\n\t\t\ttheir freedom. This decision\n\t\t\tcould very well destroy the very\n\t\t\tfoundation of our great Republic.\n\t\t\tI pray you do not let fear push\n\t\t\tyou into a disastrous decision.\n\t\t\tVote down this security measure,\n\t\t\twhich is nothing less than a\n\t\t\tdeclaration of war! Does anyone\n\t\t\there want that? I cannot believe\n\t\t\tthey do.\n\nThere is an undercurrent of booing... and groaning. SENATOR ORN FREE TAA moves his pod next to AMIDALA.\n\n\t\t\t\tORN FREE TAA\n\t\t\tMy motion to defer the vote must\n\t\t\tbe dealt with first. That is the\n\t\t\trule of law.\n\nAMIDALA looks angry and frustrated. PALPATINE gives her a sympathetic look.\n\n\t\t\t\tPALPATINE\n\t\t\tDue to the lateness of the hour\n\t\t\tand the seriousness of this\n\t\t\tmotion, we will take up these\n\t\t\tmatters tomorrow. Until then, the\n\t\t\tSenate stands adjourned.",
