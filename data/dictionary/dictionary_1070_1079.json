The doors of the exit-port slide open.\n\n\t\t\t\tDROID CAPTAIN\n\t\t\tYour Excellency!\n\nCOUNT DOOKU turns as OBI-WAN and ANAKIN run in through the hanger doors. They draw their lightsabers. The DROIDS raise their weapons.\n\n\t\t\t\tCOUNT DOOKU\n\t\t\tThat won't be necessary, Captain.\n\t\t\tStand down. And leave them to me.\n\nThe DROIDS lower their weapons and back off to the walls. COUNT DOOKU looks at OBI-WAN and ANAKIN with slight amusement.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\t\t(to Anakin)\n\t\t\tWe move in together - you slowly\n\t\t\ton the...\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tI'm taking him now!\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tAnakin, no!\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tYou'll pay for all the Jedi you've\n\t\t\tkilled today, Dooku.\n\nANAKIN charges across the open space at COUNT DOOKU, who smiles faintly, watching him come. ANAKIN raises his lightsaber. At the last moment, COUNT DOOKU thrusts out an arm, and ANAKIN is lifted up, hurled across the room, and slammed into the opposite wall. He slumps to the foot of the wall, semi-conscious. COUNT DOOKU moves toward OBI-WAN\n\n\t\t\t\tCOUNT DOOKU\n\t\t\tKenobi, isn't it? As you can see,\n\t\t\tmy Jedi powers are far beyond\n\t\t\tyours. Now, back down.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tI don't think so.\n\nOBI-WAN lifts his lightsaber. COUNT DOOKU smiles.\n\n\t\t\t\tCOUNT DOOKU\n\t\t\tAh, but if I must.\n\nCOUNT DOOKU draws his lightsaber. He and OBI-WAN start to circle each other.\n\n\t\t\t\tCOUNT DOOKU\n\t\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\t\tI have spent the last ten years\n\t\t\tlearning to use the power of the\n\t\t\tDark Side. It gives me infinitely\n\t\t\tgreater power.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tYou will have to prove it.\n\nOBI-WAN comes in fast, swinging at COUNT DOOKU'S head. DOOKU parries the cut easily. As they fight, it quickly becomes clear that DOOKU is the complete swordsman - elegant, graceful, classical - a master of the old style.\n\n\t\t\t\tCOUNT DOOKU\n\t\t\tGrand Master Kenobi, you\n\t\t\tdisappoint me. Yoda holds you in\n\t\t\tsuch high esteem.\n\nCOUNT DOOKU parried another cut.\n\n\t\t\t\tCOUNT DOOKU\n\t\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\t\tSurely you can do better...?\n\t\t\t\t(parries)\n\t\t\tNo, I'm surprised. Has Jedi\n\t\t\tswordsmanship degenerated so\n\t\t\tquickly, or are you trying to make\n\t\t\tfun of me?\n\t\t\t\t(cuts)\n\t\t\tWhich is it?\n\nCOUNT DOOKU thrusts. OBI-WAN steps back quickly, panting for breath.\n\n\t\t\t\tCOUNT DOOKU\n\t\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\t\tcome, come, Master Kenobi. Put me\n\t\t\tout of my misery.\n\nOBI-WAN takes a deep breath, gets a fresh grip on his lightsaber and comes in again. For a moment, he drives COUNT DOOKU back. Then Dooku's superior skill begins to tell again, and he forces OBI-WAN to retreat.\n\nCOUNT DOOKU increases the tempo of his attack. OBI-WAN is pushed to the limit to defend himself. DOOKU presses. His lightsaber flashes.\n\nOBI-WAN is wounded in the shoulder, then the thigh. He stumbles back against the wall, trips, and falls. His lightsaber goes skittering across the floor.\n\nCOUNT DOOKU raises his lightsaber. OBI-WAN looks up helplessly. Dooku's lightsaber flashes down and CLASHES against - Anakin's lightsaber! COUNT DOOKU and ANAKIN stare eyeball to eyeball.\n\n\t\t\t\tCOUNT DOOKU\n\t\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\t\tThat's brave of you, boy - but\n\t\t\tfoolish. I would have thought\n\t\t\tyou'd have learnt your lesson.\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tI'm a slow learner.\n\nAnd ANAKIN charges at COUNT DOOKU. The force of his attack catches the Count slightly off balance. Anakin's lightsaber flashes. COUNT DOOKU draws back, putting a hand to his arm. He takes the hand away and looks at the smear of blood whee Anakin has nicked him.\n\n\t\t\t\tCOUNT DOOKU\n\t\t\tYou have unusual powers, young\n\t\t\tPadawan. But not enought to save\n\t\t\tyou this time.\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tDon't bet on it!\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tAnakin!\n\nOBI-WAN uses the Force to catch his lightsaber and he tosses it to ANAKIN. With TWO LIGHTSABERS, ANAKIN attacks. COUNT DOOKU parries and ripostes. It is no contest. ANAKIN is driven back against the wall. He loses one lightsaber. Finally COUNT DOOKU, in one flashing move, sends Anakin's arm, cut at the elbow, flying still gripping his lightsaber. ANAKIN drops to the ground in agony. COUNT DOOKU draws himself up to deliver the coup de grace.\n\nSuddenly, the great doors slide open. The DROIDS turn fast, raising their weapons. Through the thick smoke, emerges the heroic figure of YODA. He stops on the smoke-filled threashold, FOUR DROIDS lined up on either side of him, guns pointed.\n\nBefore the DROIDS can get off a shot, YODA raises his hand, and the DROIDS are flung against the far walls and crash to the floor in heaps of smoking metal.\n\nSilence. COUNT DOOKU steps away from ANAKIN to face the Jedi Grand Master. His lightsaber whirls in a formal salute.\n\n\t\t\t\tCOUNT DOOKU\n\t\t\tMaster Yoda. At last we shall\n\t\t\tknow who is the most powerful.\n\nYODA draws a miniature lightsaber out of his cane. He salutes formally.\n\n\t\t\t\tYODA\n\t\t\tCount Dooku. No interest in\n\t\t\tcontests, do I have.\n\nCOUNT DOOKU charges across the space at YODA. He rains down blows upon the tiny figure. YODA doesn't budge an inch. For the first part of the contest, he parries every cut and thrust that Dooku aims. Nothing the great swordsman tries gets through. His energy drains. His strokes become feebler, slower.\n\nYODA attacks! He flies forward. COUNT DOOKU is forced to retreat. Wprds are insufficient to describe the range and skill of Yoda's speed and swordplay. His lightsaber his a humming blur of light.\n\nCount Dooku's lightsaber is sent cartwheeling from his hand. He staggers back, gasping and spent, against the control panel. YODA jumps onto DOOKU'S shoulders, and is about to drive the lightsaber into the top of the Count's head.\n\n\t\t\t\tYODA\n\t\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\t\tThe end for you, Count, this is.\n\n\t\t\t\tCOUNT DOOKU\n\t\t\t...Not yet...\n\nCOUNT DOOKU raises his arms and knocks YODA off his shoulders and then, with all his might, he uses the Force to pull on one of the cranes in the hanger. It comes crashing down on OBI-WAN and ANAKIN. But in the blink of and eye, YODA is under the crane, holding it up, using the Force. YODA closes his eyes and concentrates.\n\nANAKIN is unconscious, and OBI0WAN tries toget out from under the crane. The fallen crane trembles and starts to life. Behind it, the sound of the Sail Ship's engines are heard starting up.\n\nYODA concentrates harder. Slowly, the crane rises. The SOUND OF THE ENGINES increases. YODA exerts every scrap of his powers. The crane lifts clear of ANAKIN and is thrown to the ground. DOOKU'S Sail Ship takes off. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN struggle to the exhausted YODA, but it's too late. The Sail Ship rises into the air and flies away. PADM� and a CLONE CAPTAIN with about TEN TROOPERS appear in the doorway.\n\n\t\t\t\tPADM�\n\t\t\tAnakin!\n\nPADM� runs too him and throws her arms around him. ANAKIN is barely able to stand up. The CLONE CAPTAIN marches up to YODA, stops, and salutes smartly.\n\n\t\t\t\tCLONE CAPTAIN\n\t\t\tResistance is at an end, General.\n\t\t\tWhat are your orders ?\n\nYODA looks at him and sighs.",
