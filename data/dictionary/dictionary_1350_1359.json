Ten Vulture Droids straight ahead, coming down the left side. \n\nARTOO BEEPS a worried message. \n\nOBI-WAN: Add five Tri-fighters on the right . . . \n\nANAKIN: I'm going head to head. See you. \n\nOBI-WAN: Take it easy, Anakin. \n\nFour Clone Fighters move into formation behind the Jedi. \n\nODD BALL: I'm on your right, Red Leader. \n\nANAKIN: Incoming!! \n\nARTOO SQUEALS as five DROID TRI-FIGHTERS pass by at high speed on the right. \n\nOBI-WAN: Five more on the right! \n\nFour more VULTURE DROID FIGHTERS pass at high speed from the left. All hell breaks loose. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN continue to fly in unison, backing up each other. ARTOO SQUEALS. \n\nANAKIN: Here we go. \n\nThe Jedi ships split up and make a quick loop around the DROID TRI-FIGHTERS, ending up behind them. BLASTING away. The DROID TRI-FIGHTERS EXPLODE. \n\nOBI-WAN: I'm going high and right. \n\nANAKIN: Hang on. There are four more of them. \n\nOBI-WAN: Stay with me . . . swing back and right . . . help me engage. Back off ... Let them pass between us. \n\nANAKIN: I'm coming around. I'm coming around on your tail. \n\nOBI-WAN: All right, engage . . . and hurry. These droids are all over me like a rash. \n\nIn one incredible move, ANAKIN swings in behind the DROID TRI-FIGHTERS, blowing them away one by one until there is only one left. ARTOO CHIRPS. \n\nARTOO lets out a HOWL as ANAKIN accelerates past the last DROID TRI-FIGHTER, slams on his brakes, flips the Fighter around, and BLASTS the Fighter from the front. ARTOO BEEPS frantically as they fly through the debris of the destroyed ships. ANAKIN looks behind him. \n\nANAKIN: How many back there. Artoo? (Artoo beeps) Three . . . (continuing) Four . . . that's not good. \n\nOBI-WAN: Anakin, you have four on your tail. \n\nANAKIN: I know. I know! \n\nOBI-WAN: Four more closing from your left. \n\nANAKIN: I know. I know! \n\nOBI-WAN: Break right and go high. \n\nANAKIN: I'm going low and left. \n\nObi-Wan shakes his head. \n\nOBI-WAN: (to himself) He still has much to learn. \n\nANAKIN swoops low and skims across a TRADE FEDERATION BATTLESHIP, dodging flack as ARTOO bounces along, trying to get out a sentence. \n\nANAKIN: Hang on, Artoo. Obi-Wan, do you copy? I'm going to pull them through the needle . . . \n\nOBI-WAN: Too dangerous. First Jedi rule: \"Survive.\" \n\nANAKIN: Sorry, no choice. Come down here and thin them out a little. \n\nOBI-WAN drops in behind the DROID VULTURE FIGHTERS chasing Anakin. ARFOUR BEEPS to OBI-WAN. \n\nOBI-WAN: Just keep me steady . . . hold on ... not yet. . . now break left. \n\nOBI-WAN fires as he swings across the back of the VULTURE DROIDS, BLASTING four of them away. ANAKIN heads for a trench along the surface of one of the Trade Federation Battleships. He flies into the trench, which ends in a conning tower with a small slit between two main struts. \n\nOBI-WAN: (continuing) You'll never get through there, Anakin. It's too tight. \n\nARTOO BEEPS nervously. \n\nANAKIN: Easy, Artoo . . . we've done this before. \n\nOBI-WAN: Use the Force, think yourself through, the ship will follow. \n\nARTOO SQUEALS in a panic. On the view screen Artoo's squeal reads out, \"WE'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE IT.\" \n\nANAKIN: Wrong thought, Artoo. \n\nANAKIN slips through the narrow gap. The trailing VULTURE DROID FIGHTERS CRASH. \n\nANAKIN: (continuing) I'm through. \n\nOBI-WAN continues to fire on the VULTURE DROID FIGHTERS, driving them into the EXPLOSION. \nA CLONE fighter is hit and explodes, spewing debris. The CLONE PILOT spins off into space. \nFinally, OBI-WAN peels off and swings around, pulling up alongside ANAKIN. CLONE FIGHT SQUAD SEVEN battles the DROIDS. \n\nODD BALL: There are too many of them. \n\nCLONE PILOT 2: I'm on your wing. Break left. Break left. They're all over me. Get them off my . . . \n\nANAKIN: I'm going to go help them out! \n\nOBI-WAN: No, no! They are doing their job so we can do ours. Head for the Command Ship! \n\nAnother CLONE fighter is hit, bursts into flames, and spins off into space. A VULTURE DROID FIGHTER raises its head to locate its target and fires missiles at them. \n\nANAKIN: Missiles! Pull up! \n\nANAKIN and OBI-WAN break right and left, and the missiles follow them. ANAKIN does a barrel roll spin, causing the missiles following him to collide and EXPLODE. Two missiles continue to chase OBI-WAN. He banks sharply to the right, then to the left, causing one of the missiles to overshoot. \n\nOBI-WAN: They overshot us . . . \n\nThe second missile streaks next to Obi-Wan�s Fighter and EXPLODES. Obi-Wan's ship rocks, and R-4, SCREAMS as the Starfighter rips through the explosion. Debris flies all around them. \n\nANAKIN: They're coming around! \n\nOBI-WAN: All right, Arfour. No, no. Nothing too fancy. \n\nANAKIN: Surge all power units. Artoo! Stand by the reverse thrusters. \n\nANAKIN spins his starfighter. The missiles spin and collide. \n\nANAKIN: We got 'em. Artoo! \n\nTwo missiles continue to track Obi-Wan. \n\nOBI-WAN: Flying is for droids. \n\nSuddenly, OBI-WAN shudders, and his ship starts to plummet toward the surface of the Trade Federation Cruiser. The trailing missiles fly into what looks like debris, and detonate. Five silver balls fly out of the debris and attach themselves to the ship. The balls pop open, revealing SMALL BUZZDROIDS that begin to crawl across the surface like spiders. \n\nOBI-WAN: (continuing) I'm hit! Anakin? \n\nANAKIN: I see them . . . Buzz Droids. \n\nThe BUZZ DROIDS crawl across Obi-Wan's ship and start to tear it apart. SPARKS ERUPT where the BUZZ DROIDS break into the wiring. One of the BUZZ DROIDS goes after ARFOUR. \n\nOBI-WAN: Arfour, be careful. You have one . . . \n\nARFOUR's head gets ripped off and flies away. \n\nOBI-WAN: Oh dear. They're shutting down all the controls. \n\nANAKIN: Move to the right so I can get a clear shot at them. \n\nOBI-WAN: The mission. Get to the Command Ship. Get the Chancellor! I'm running out of tricks here. \n\nANAKIN moves into position just off Obi-Wan's left side and angles his ship so his guns are pointing at the DROIDS crawling over Obi-Wan�s Starfighter. ANAKIN fires and vaporizes the TWO BUZZ DROIDS, along with the left wing of Obi-Wan's ship. \n\nOBI-WAN: (continuing) In the name of ... \n\nANAKIN: Steady . . . steady . . . \n\nOBI-WAN: Anakin, hold your fire . . . hold your fire. You're not helping here. \n\nANAKIN: I agree, bad idea. Swing right . . . ease over . . . steady . . . \n\nOBI-WAN: Wait . . . wait . . . I can't see a thing! My cockpit's fogging. They're all over me, Anakin. \n\nANAKIN: Move to the right. \n\nOBI-WAN: Hold on, Anakin. You're going to get us both killed! Get out of here. There's nothing more you can do. \n\nANAKIN: I'm not leaving without you, Master. \n\nANAKIN moves his ship next to OBI-WAN's and tries to physically knock the BUZZ DROIDS off. There are five left. He manages to get one off, but badly dents OBI-WAN's ship in the process. One of the BUZZ DROIDS tears apiece off of the front of Obi-Wan's ship. Flames burst out, and more smoke billows out, obscuring the Jedi's view. \n\nANAKIN knocks off three of the BUZZ DROIDS and the fourth crawls out onto Anakin's ship and starts attacking ARTOO. ARTOO fights the BUZZ DROID. \n\nOBI-WAN: Blast it ... I can't see . . . my controls are gone. \n\nANAKIN: Get 'em, Artoo. Watch out! \n\nOBI-WAN: Artoo, hit the buzz droid's center eye. \n\nARTOO extends an arm and aims a stream of electricity at the swerving BUZZ DROID. The BUZZ DROID is hit squarely in the eye and falls off the ship. \n\nANAKIN: Yeah, you got him! \n\nOBI-WAN: Great, Artoo. \n\nANAKIN: Stay on my wing . . . the General's Command Ship is dead ahead. Easy . . . pull up ... Head for the hangar. \n\nOBI-WAN: Have you noticed the shields are still up? \n\nANAKIN: Oh?!? Sorry, Master. \n\nANAKIN streaks ahead of OBI-WAN's disintegrating Jedi Fighter and blasts the shield generator. It SPARKS and EXPLODES. \n\nOBI-WAN: Oh, I have a bad feeling about this. \n\n9",

ANAKIN dips his hand into the fluid and sniffs it. \n\nOBI-WAN: . . . fuel. The slightest charge from our sabers will send this ship into oblivion. That's why they've stopped shooting. \n\nANAKIN: Well then, we're safe for the time being. \n\nOBI-WAN: Your idea of safe is not the same as mine. \n\nThey run, EXPLOSIONS rattle the ship, and pipes continue to burst around them, spilling more fuel into the hallway. At the far end, SIX SUPER BATTLE DROIDS drop into the fuel. The SOUNDS OF SHIELD DOORS CLOSING AND LOCKING ECHO throughout the hallway. They pass several large power generators, which are topped with SPARKING excess power dischargers. \n\nANAKIN: They're sealing this section off. \n\nOBI-WAN: Six droids coming our way! \n\nThe last of the DOORS CAN BE HEARD CLOSING in the distance. \n\nANAKIN: Keep moving.

It's too small! \n\nThey move toward a second vent. OBI-WAN is swimming in the fuel as it reaches to within a couple yards of the ceiling. ANAKIN feels along the ceiling and finds another smaller vent. He closes his eyes and tries to sense an opening, then he moves on. OBI-WAN is forced into hand-to-hand combat with one of the SUPER BATTLE DROIDS. It pulls the Jedi under the fuel. Just before he is about to drown, OBI-WAN disables the SUPER BATTLE DROID by pushing him into an exhaust pipe. \n\nThe fuel is up to the Jedi's chins. ANAKIN finds a very, very small metal grate, then pounds on it until the tiny grate breaks loose. \n\nANAKIN: I found our escape vent. \n\nOBI-WAN: Anakin, this is no time for jokes. We're in serious trouble here. \n\nANAKIN: Only in your mind. My Master.
