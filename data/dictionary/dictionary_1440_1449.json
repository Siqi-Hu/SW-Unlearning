However it may turn out just to be a wild bantha chase. \n\nOBI-WAN starts to turn and leave. \n\nANAKIN: Master! \n\nOBI-WAN stops and ANAKIN walks over to him. \n\nANAKIN: (continuing) Master, I've disappointed you. I have not been very appreciative of your training . . . I have been arrogant and I apologize . . . I've just been so frustrated with the Council. Your friendship means everything to me. \n\nOBI-WAN: You are strong and wise, Anakin, and I am very proud of you. I have trained you since you were a small boy. I have taught you everything I know. And you have become a far greater Jedi than I could ever hope to be, and you have saved my life more times than I can remember. But be patient, Anakin. It won't be long before the Council makes you a Jedi Master. \n\nOBI-WAN starts down the ramp, then turns back. \n\nOBI-WAN: (continuing) Don't worry. I have enough clones with me to take three systems the size of Utapau. I think I'll be able to handle the situation . . . even without your help. \n\nANAKIN: Well, there's always a first time. \n\nOBI-WAN laughs. \n\nThey talk for a few more minutes before ANAKIN watches OBI-WAN depart. \n\nANAKIN: Obi-Wan, may the Force be with you. \n\nOBI-WAN: Good-bye, old friend. May the Force be with you. \n\nOBI-WAN heads down a ramp toward the waiting Republic cruiser. \n\n97",
