        "passage": "The Senate chambers are huge. Thousands of SENATORS and their AIDES sit in\nthe circular assembly area. CHANCELLOR VALORUM sits in an elevated area in\nthe center. Hindreds of AIDES and DROIDS hurry about. SENATOR PALPATINE,\nQUEEN AMIDALA, EIRTA, RABE, and CAPTAIN PANAKA sit in the Naboo\ncongressional box, which is actually a floating platform. PALPATINE leans\nover to the QUEEN.\n\nPALPATINE : If the Federation moves to defer the motion...Your Majesty,\nIbeg of you to ask for a resolution to end this congressional session.\nAMIDALA : I wish I had your confidence in this, Senator.\nPALPATINE : You must force a new election for Supreme Chancellor...I\npromise you there are many who will support us...it is our best chance...\nYour Majesty, our only, chance.\nAMIDALA : You truely believe Chancellor Valorum will not bring our motion\nto a vote?\nPALAPATINE : He is distracted...he is afraid. He will be of no help.\nVALORUM : The Chair recognizes the Senator from the sovereign system of\nNaboo.\n\nThe Naboo congressional box floats into the center.\n\nPALPATINE : Supreme Chancellor, delegates of the Senate. A tragedy has\noccured on our peaceful system of Naboo. We have become caugt in a dispute\nyou're all well aware of, which began right here with the taxation of trade\nroutes, and has now engulfed our entire planet in the oppresion of the\nTrade Federation.\n\nA second box rushes into the center of the Senate. It is filled with\nFederation trade barons led by LOTT DOD, the Senator for the Federation.\n\nLOTT DOD : This is outrageous! I object to the Senator's statements!\nVALORUM : The Chair does not recognize the Senator from the Trade\nFederation at this time. Please return to your station.\n\nLOTT DOD reluctantly moves back to his place.\n\nPALPATINE : To state our allegations, I present Queen Amidala, the recently\nelected ruler of Naboo, to speak on our behalf.\n\nQUEEN AMIDALA stands and addresses the assembly. There is some applause.\n\nAMIDALA : Honorable representatives of the Republic, distinguished\ndelegates, and Your Honor Supreme Chancellor Valorum, I come to you under\nthe gravest of circumstances. The Naboo system has been invaded by force.\nInvaded...against all the laws of the Republic by the Droid Armies of the\nTrade...\nLOTT DOD : I object! There is no proof. This is incredible. We recommend a\ncommision be sent to Naboo to assertain the truth.\nVALORUM : Overruled.\nLOTT DOD : Your Honor, you cannot allow us to be condemned without\nreasonable observation. It's against all the rules of procedure.\n\nA third box representing Malastare moves into the center of the room. AKS\nMOE, the Ambassador, addresses the convention.\n\nAKS MOE : The Congress of Malastare concurs with the honorable delegate\nfrom the Trade Federation. A commision must be appointed...that is the law.\nVALORUM : The point...\n\nVALORUM confers with several of his AIDES and VICE CHAIRMAN MAS AMEDDA.\nPALPATINE whispers something to the QUEEN.\n\nPALPATINE : Enter the bureaucrats, the true rulers of the Republic, and on\nthe payroll of the Trade Federation, I might add. This is where Chancellor\nValorum's strength will dissapear.\nVALORUM : The point is conceded...Section 523A take precedence here. Queen\nAmidala of the Naboo, will you defer your motion to allow a commission to\nexplore the validity of your accusations?\n\nQUEEN AMIDALA is angry but remains composed.\n\nAMIDALA : (angrily) I will not defer...I have come before you to resolve\nthis attack on our sovereignty now. I was not elected to watch my people\nsuffer and die while you discuss this invasion in a committee. If this body\nis not capable of action, I suggest new leadership is needed. I move for a\n\"vote of no confidence\"...in Chancellor Valorum's leadership.\nVALORUM : What?...No!\n\nThis causes a great stir in the assembly. A loud mumur cresendos into a\nroar of approval and jeers. CHANCELLOR VALORUM is stunned and stands\nspeechless. His Vice Chair, MAS AMEDDA, takes over.\n\nMAS AMEDDA : Order! We shall have order...\n\nThings settledown a little. The Federation box settles next to AMIDALA.\nPRINCE BAIL ORGANA moves his box into the arena.\n\nBAIL ORGANA : Alderaan seconds the motion for a vote of no confidence in\nChancellor Valorum.\nMAD AMEDDA : The motion has been seconded by Bail Organa of Alderaan.\n\nMAS AMEDDA turns to the confused VALORUM, and whispers something to him.\n\nBAIL ORGANA : There must be no delays. The motion is on the floor and must\nbe voted upon in this session.\nLOTT DOD : The Trade Federation moves the motion be sent to the procedures\ncommittee for study.\n\nThe assembly begins to chant. VALORUM talks to MAS AMEDDA.\n\nASSEMBLY : Vote now! Vote now! Vote now!\n\nPALPATINE stands next to AMIDALA.\n\nPALPATINE : You see, Your Majaesty, the tide is with us...Valorum will be\nvoted out, I assure you, and they will elect in a new Chancellor, a strong\nChancellor, one who will not let our tragedy continue...\nMAS AMEDDA : Thew Supreme Chancellor requests a recess. Tomorrow we will\nbegin the vote.\n\nThe Federation delegation is furious. VALORUM turns to PALPATINE.\n\nVALORUM : Palpatine, I thought you were my ally...my friend. You have\nbetrayed me!
