Two\n      stormtroopers, who follow, immediately spot Luke and open\n      fire on him. The youth draws his weapon and blasts the two\n      troopers before they can get off a second shot. The two\n      guards whisk Han into another hallway as Fett lowers his arm\n      and fires a deadly laser at Luke, which explodes to one side\n      and tears up a huge chunk of wall.\n\n      Luke rushes to a side hallway, but by the time he reaches\n      it, Fett, Han, and the guards are gone. A think metal door\n      blocks the passage. Luke turns to see Leia, Chewie,\n      Threepio, and Lando being herded down a second hallway by\n      several other stormtroopers.

He raises his hand.\nHis sword, which had fallen on another part of the platform,\nswiftly jumps into his outstretched hand and is instantly\nignited. Vader immediately lights his sword as well.\n\n                    VADER (CONT’D)\n          Obi-Wan has taught you well. You\n          have controlled your fear... now\n          release your anger.\n\nLuke is more cautious, controlling his anger. He begins to\nretreat as Vader goads him on.

Luke presses forward.\n\n                    VADER (CONT’D)\n          Only your hatred can destroy me.\n\nBreathing hard, Luke jumps in the air, turning a somersault\nover Vader.

Vader blocks\n      the sword, but looses his balance and falls into the outer\n      rim of pipes. The energy Luke has used to stop Vader has\n      brought him to the point of collapse. Luke moves to the\n      edge and looks down, but sees no sign of Vader. He then\n      deactivates his sword, hooks it on his belt, and lowers\n      himself into the pit.\n\n224",
