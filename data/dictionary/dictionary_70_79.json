I'm entered in the Boonta Race\ntomorrow!\nKITSTER : What? With this??\nWALD : (subtitled) Annie, Jesko na joka. 9You are such a joke, Annie.)\nAMEE : You've been working on that thing for years. It's never going to\nrun.\nSEEK : Come on, let's go play ball. Keep it up, Annie, and you're gonna be\nbug squash.\n\nSEEK, WALD, and AMEE take off, laughing. JAR JAR is fiddling with one of\nthe energy binder plates.\n\nANAKIN : Hey! Jar Jar! Stay away from those energy binders...\nJAR JAR : Who, mesa?\nANAKIN : If your hand gets caught in that beam, it will go numb for hours.\n\nJAR JAR peeks at the energy plate; it makes a little electronic pop, zaps\nhim in the mouth and jumps back. JAR JAR tries to say something, but his\nmouth is numb and his words are garbled.\n\nJAR JAR : Ouch-dats muy bigo Oucho. (Gibberish)\nKITSTER : But you don't even know if this thing will run.\nANAKIN : It will.\n\nQUI-GON approaches the GROUP and gives ANAKIN a small battery. JAR JAR gets\nhis hand caught in the afterburner and tries to tell Anakin, but can't get\nwords out that make sense.\n\nQUI-GON : I think it's time we found out. Use this power charge. ANAKIN :\nYes, sir!!\n\nANAKIN jumps into the little capsule behind the two giant engines. He puts\nthe power pack back into the dashboard. EVERYONE backs away, except for JAR\nJAR who calls for help. Finally PADME frees him and the engines ignite with\na ROAR. EVERYONE cheers.",
