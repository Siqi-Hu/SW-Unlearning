Then a huge asteroid tumbles across his path. There seem no way he can avoid it. OBI-WAN fires a couple of aerial torpedoes. They streak toward the asteroid.\n\nIN JANGO'S COCKPIT, they see the huge explosion as Obi-Wan's ship appears to smash into the asteroid.\n\n\t\t\t\tBOBA FETT\n\t\t\tGot him! Yeahhhhh!\n\n\t\t\t\tJANGO FETT\n\t\t\tWe won't see him again.\n\nBOBA FETT laughs. Jango Fett's ship emerges from the asteroid belt and heads down toward the planet of Geonosis.",
