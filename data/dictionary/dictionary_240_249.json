The murky, moldy\n     den is filled with a startling array of weird and exotic\n     alien creatures and monsters at the long metallic bar. At\n     first the sight is horrifying. One-eyed, thousand-eyed,\n     slimy, furry, scaly, tentacled, and clawed creatures huddle\n     over drinks. Ben moves to an empty spot at the bar near a\n     group of repulsive but human scum.

He notices several of the gruesome\ncreatures along the bar are giving him a very unfriendly\nglare.\n\nLuke pats Threepio on the shoulder.\n\n                    LUKE\n          Listen, why don't you wait out by\n          the speeder.

His large blue eyes dominate a fur-\ncovered face and soften his otherwise awesome appearance.\nOver his matted, furry body he wears two chrome bandoliers,\nand little else. He is a two-hundred-year-old Wookiee and a\nsight to behold.\n\nBen speaks to the Wookiee, pointing to Luke several times\nduring his conversation and the huge creature suddenly lets\nout a horrifying laugh. Luke is more than a little bit\ndisconcerted and pretends not to hear the conversation\nbetween Ben and the giant Wookiee.\n\nLuke is terrified but tries not to show it. He quietly sips\nhis drink, looking over the crowd for a more sympathetic ear\nor whatever.\n\nA large, multiple-eyed Creature gives Luke a rough shove.\n\n                    CREATURE\n          Negola dewaghi wooldugger?!?\n\nThe hideous freak is obviously drunk.

Luke tries to remain cool but it isn't easy. His\nthree adversaries ready their weapons. Old Ben moves in\nbehind Luke.\n\n                    BEN\n          This little one isn't worth the\n          effort. Come let me buy you\n          something...\n\nA powerful blow from the unpleasant creature sends the young\nwould-be Jedi sailing across the room, crashing through\ntables and breaking a large jug filled with a foul-looking\nliquid. With a blood curdling shriek, the monster draws a\nwicked chrome laser pistol from his belt and levels it at\nold Ben. The bartender panics.\n\n                    BARTENDER\n          No blasters! No blaster!\n\nWith astounding agility old Ben's laser sword sparks to life\nand in a flash an arm lies on the floor. The rodent is cut\nin two and the giant multiple-eyed creature lies doubled,\ncut from chin to groin. Ben carefully and precisely turns\noff his laser sword and replaces it on his utility belt.\nLuke, shaking and totally amazed at the old man's abilities,\nattempts to stand. The entire fight has lasted only a matter\nof seconds. The cantina goes back to normal, although Ben is\ngiven a respectable amount of room at the bar. Luke, rubbing\nhis bruised head, approaches the old man with new awe. Ben\npoints the the Wookiee.\n\n                         BEN\n               This is Chewbacca.

Tell\n                  Jabba...\n\n                            GREEDO\n                  Jabba's through with you. He has no\n                  time for smugglers who drop their\n                  shipments at the first sign of an\n                  Imperial cruiser.\n\n                            HAN\n                  Even I get boarded sometimes. Do\n                  you think I had a choice?\n\n     Han Solo slowly reaches for his gun under the table.\n\n                            GREEDO\n                  You can tell that to Jabba. He may\n                  only take your ship.\n\n                            HAN\n                  Over my dead body.\n\n                            GREEDO\n                  That's the idea. I've been looking\n                  forward to killing you for a long\n                  time.\n\n                            HAN\n                  Yes, I'll bet you have.\n\n     Suddenly the slimy alien disappears in a blinding flash of\n     light. Han pulls his smoking gun from beneath the table as\n     the other patron look on in bemused amazement. Han gets up\n     and starts out of the cantina, flipping the bartender some\n     coins as he leaves.\n\n                            HAN (CONTâ€™D)\n                  Sorry about the mess.\n\n62",
