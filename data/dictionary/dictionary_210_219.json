The shrouded little creatures smell\n     horribly, attracting small insects to the dark areas when\n     their mouths and nostrils should be.\n\n     Out of the shadows of a dingy side-building limps Owen Lars,\n     a large burly man in his mid-fifties. His reddish eyes are\n     sunken in a dust-covered face. As the farmer carefully\n     inspects each robot, he is closely followed by his slump-\n     shouldered nephew, Luke Skywalker.

He is restrained\nby a slimy Jawa, who zaps him with a control box.\n\nOwen is negotiating with the head Jawa.

He sits up and sees a twelve-inch three-\ndimensional hologram of Leia Organa, the Rebel senator,\nbeing projected from the face of little Artoo.

And it's a private message\n          for him. Quite frankly, sir I don't\n          know what he's talking about. Our\n          last master was Captain Antilles,\n          but with what we've been through,\n          this little R2 unit has become a\n          bit eccentric.\n\n                    LUKE\n          Obi-Wan Kenobi?

It sounds like\n          she's in trouble. I'd better play\n          back the whole thing.\n\nArtoo beeps something to Threepio.\n\n                    THREEPIO\n          He says the restraining bolt has\n          short circuited his recording\n          system. He suggests that if you\n          remove the bolt, he might be able\n          to play back the entire recording.\n\nLuke looks longingly at the lovely, little princess and\nhasn't really heard what Threepio has been saying.\n\n                    LUKE\n          H'm? Oh, yeah, well, I guess you're\n          too small to run away on me if I\n          take this off! Okay.\n\nLuke takes a wedged bar and pops the restraining bolt off\nArtoo's side.\n\n                    LUKE (CONT’D)\n          There you go.\n\nThe princess immediately disappears...\n\n                    LUKE (CONT’D)\n          Well, wait a minute. Where'd she\n          go? Bring her back! Play back the\n          entire message.\n\nArtoo beeps an innocent reply as Threepio sits up in\nembarrassment.\n\n                    THREEPIO\n          What message? The one you're\n          carrying inside your rusty innards!\n\nA women's voice calls out from another room.\n\n                    AUNT BERU\n          Luke? Luke! Come to dinner!\n\nLuke stands up and shakes his head at the malfunctioning\nrobot.\n\n                     LUKE\n          All right, I'll be right there,\n          Aunt Beru.\n\n                    THREEPIO\n          I'm sorry, sir, but he appears to\n          have picked up a slight flutter.\n\nLuke tosses Artoo's restraining bolt on the workbench and\nhurries out of the room.\n\n                    LUKE\n          Well, see what you can do with him.\n          I'll be right back.\n\n                    THREEPIO\n              (to Artoo)\n          Just you reconsider playing that\n          message for him.\n\nArtoo beeps in response.\n\n                         THREEPIO (CONT’D)\n               No, I don't think he likes you at\n               all.\n\n     Artoo beeps.\n\n                         THREEPIO (CONT’D)\n               No, I don't like you either.\n\n31",

She puts the pitcher on a tray with some bowls\n     of food and starts for the dining area.\n\n     Luke sits with his Uncle Owen before a table covered with\n     steaming bowls of food as Aunt Beru carries in a bowl of red\n     grain.\n\n                         LUKE\n               You know, I think that R2 unit we\n               bought might have been stolen.\n\n                         OWEN\n               What makes you think that?\n\n                         LUKE\n               Well, I stumbled across a recording\n               while I was cleaning him. He says\n               he belongs to someone called Obi-\n               Wan Kenobi.\n\n     Owen is greatly alarmed at the mention of his name, but\n     manages to control himself.\n\n                         LUKE (CONT’D)\n               I thought he might have meant old\n               Ben. Do you know what he's talking\n               about? Well, I wonder if he's\n               related to Ben.\n\n     Owen breaks loose with a fit of uncontrolled anger.\n\n                         OWEN\n               That old man's just a crazy old\n               wizard. Tomorrow I want you to take\n               that R2 unit into Anchorhead and\n               have its memory flushed. That'll be\n               the end of it. It belongs to us\n               now.\n\n                    LUKE\n          But what if this Obi-Wan comes\n          looking for him?\n\n                    OWEN\n          He won't, I don't think he exists\n          any more. He died about the same\n          time as your father.\n\n                    LUKE\n          He knew my father?\n\n                    OWEN\n          I told you to forget it. Your only\n          concern is to prepare the new\n          droids for tomorrow. In the morning\n          I want them on the south ridge\n          working out those condensers.\n\n                    LUKE\n          Yes, sir. I think those new droids\n          are going to work out fine. In\n          fact, I, uh, was also thinking\n          about our agreement about my\n          staying on another season. And if\n          these new droids do work out, I\n          want to transmit my application to\n          the Academy this year.\n\nOwen's face becomes a scowl, although he tries to suppress\nit.\n\n                    OWEN\n          You mean the next semester before\n          harvest?\n\n                    LUKE\n          Sure, there're more than enough\n          droids.\n\n                    OWEN\n          Harvest is when I need you the\n          most. Only one more season. This\n          year we'll make enough on the\n          harvest so I'll be able to hire\n          some more hands. And then you can\n          go to the Academy next year.\n\nLuke continues to toy with his food, not looking at his\nuncle.\n\n                    OWEN (CONT’D)\n          You must understand I need you\n          here, Luke.\n\n                         LUKE\n               But it's a whole 'nother year.\n\n                         OWEN\n               Look, it's only one more season.\n\n     Luke pushes his half-eaten plate of food aside and stands.\n\n                         LUKE\n               Yeah, that's what you said last\n               year when Biggs and Tank left.\n\n                         AUNT BERU\n               Where are you going?\n\n                         LUKE\n               It looks like I'm going nowhere. I\n               have to finish cleaning those\n               droids.\n\n     Resigned to his fate, Luke paddles out of the room. Owen\n     mechanically finishes his dinner.\n\n                         AUNT BERU\n               Owen, he can't stay here forever.\n               Most of his friends have gone. It\n               means so much to him.\n\n                         OWEN\n               I'll make it up to him next year. I\n               promise.\n\n                         AUNT BERU\n               Luke's just not a farmer, Owen. He\n               has too much of his father in him.\n\n                         OWEN\n               That's what I'm afraid of.\n\n32",
