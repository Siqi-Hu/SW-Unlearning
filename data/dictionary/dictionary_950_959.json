ANAKIN blinks in surprise, then moves into the room, where ALIEN FACES look back at him with hostility, suspicion, and invitation as he moves among the tables. OBI-WAN arrives at the bar. He signals the BARMAN.\n\nCLOSE - Somewhere in the room a HAND moves to a pistol in its holster and unsnaps the safety catch. At the bar, a glass is placed in from of OBI-WAN. A drink is poured. He lifts the glass.\n\n\t\t\t\tELAN SLEAZEBAGGANO\n\t\t\tWanna buy some death sticks?\n\nOBI-WAN looks at him.

OBI-WAN lifts the drink and tosses it back.\n\nCLOSE. The gun is drawn from its holster and held down out of sight. The BOUNTY HUNTER starts to move toward the bar.\n\nANAKIN checks out ALIEN FACES. OBI-WAN signals for another drink. The gun moves toward his unsuspecting back.\n\nThe drink is poured. OBI-WAN reaches for it. The gun is raised to aim directly at his back, and suddenly OBI-WAN turns fast. His lightsaber flashes. There is a shrill SCREAM and ZAM'S ARM hits the floor. The gun drops from its twitching fingers. Blood spreads.\n\nThe room is silent. ALIENS rise menacingly from their seats, and ANAKIN is suddenly at OBI-WAN's side, his lightsaber glowing.\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tEasy... Official business. Go\n\t\t\tback to your drinks.\n\nSlowly, the ALIENS sit. Conversation resumes. Onstage, THE PERFORMERS pick up their routine. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN lift ZAM and carry her out.",

You're\n\t\t\texactly the way I remember you in\n\t\t\tmy dreams. I doubt if Naboo has\n\t\t\tchanged much either.\n\n\t\t\t\tPADM�\n\t\t\tIt hasn't...\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tI can't wait to breathe the sweet\n\t\t\tbreeze that comes off the rolling\n\t\t\thills. Whenever I try to\n\t\t\tvisualise the Force, those hills\n\t\t\tare what I see.\n\nANAKIN looks at PADME when he says this.\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\t\tI love Naboo.\n\nThere is an awkward moment.\n\n\t\t\t\tPADM�\n\t\t\t\t(changing the subject)\n\t\t\tWere you dreaming about you\n\t\t\tmother earlier, weren't you?\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tYes... I left Tatooine so long\n\t\t\tago, my memory of her is fading.\n\t\t\tI don't want to lose it. Recently\n\t\t\tI've been seeing her in my\n\t\t\tdreams... vivid dreams... scary\n\t\t\tdreams. I worry about her.\n\nPADME gives ANAKIN a sympathetic look.",
