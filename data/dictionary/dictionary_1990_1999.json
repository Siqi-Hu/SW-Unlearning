Vader and the officer walk to the\n     landing platform, where the shuttle is coming to rest.\n\n     The shuttle's ramp lowers and the Emperor's Royal Guards come\n     out and create a lethal perimeter. The assembled troops move\n     to rigid attention with a momentous SNAP.\n\n     Then, in the huge SILENCE which follows, the EMPEROR appears.\n     He is a rather small, shriveled old man. His bent frame\n     slowly makes its way down the ramp with the aid of a gnarled\n     cane. He wears a hooded cloak similar to the one Ben wears,\n     except that it is black.

We also know that\n          the weapon systems of this Death\n          Star are not yet operational. With\n          the Imperial Fleet spread\n          throughout the galaxy in a vain\n          effort to engage us, it is\n          relatively unprotected.\n                    (MORE)\n\n                    MON MOTHMA (CONT’D)\n          But most important of all, we've\n          learned that the Emperor himself is\n          personally overseeing the final\n          stages of the construction of this\n          Death Star.\n\nA volley of spirited chatter erupts from the crowd. Han turns\nto Leia as Chewie barks his amazement.\n\n                    MON MOTHMA   (CONT) (CONT’D)\n          Many Bothans died to bring us this\n          information. Admiral Ackbar,\n          please.\n\nAdmiral Ackbar steps forward and points to the Death Star's\nforce field and the Moon of Endor.\n\n                    ACKBAR\n          You can see here the Death Star\n          orbiting the forest Moon of Endor.\n          Although the weapon\n\nsystems on this Death Star are not yet operational, the Death\nStar does have a strong defense mechanism. It is protected by\nan energy shield, which is generated from the nearby forest\nMoon of Endor. The shield must be deactivated if any attack\nis to be attempted. Once the shield is down, our cruisers\nwill create a perimeter, while the fighters fly into the\nsuperstructure and attempt to knock out the main reactor.\n\nThere's a concerned murmur.\n\n                    ACKBAR   (CONT) (CONT’D)\n          General Calrissian has volunteered\n          to lead the fighter attack\n\nHan turns to Lando with a look of respect.\n\n                       HAN\n          Good luck.\n\nLando nods his thanks.\n\n                    HAN (CONT’D)\n          You're gonna need it.\n\n                    ACKBAR\n          General Madine.\n\nMadine moves center stage.\n\n                    GENERAL MADINE\n          We have stolen a small Imperial\n          shuttle.
