His eyes dart around the room. He reaches for his lightsaber, then smiles and puts it back in his belt.\n\nThe door to the apartment slides open, and OBI-WAN enters.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tCaptain Typho has more than enough\n\t\t\tmen downstairs. No assassin will\n\t\t\ttry that way. Any activity up\n\t\t\there?\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tQuiet as a tomb.

        "passage": "The DROID bumps against a wall, hoping to knock the Jedi loose. It moves behind a speeder afterburner to scorch him. It takesthe JEDI wildly between buildings and finally skims across a rooftop as OBI-WAN is forced to lift his legs, tenaciously hanging onto the DROID. The DROID heads for a dirty, beat-up speeder hidden in an alcove of a building about twenty stories up. When the pilot of the speeder, a scruffy bounty hunter called ZAM WESELL, sees the DROID approach with OBI-WAN hanging on, she pulls a long rifle out of the speeder and starts to fire at the JEDI. EXPLOSIONS burst all around OBI-WAN.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tI have a bad feeling about this.\n\nFINALLY, the DROID suffers a direct hit and blows up. OBI-WAN falls fifty stories, until a speeder drops down next to him, and he manages to grab onto the back end of the speeder and haul himself toward the cockpit. The JEDI struggles to climb into the passenger seat of the open speeder and sit down next to the driver, ANAKIN.\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tThat was wacky! I almost lost you\n\t\t\tin the traffic.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tWhat took you so long?\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tOh, you know, Master, I couldn't\n\t\t\tfind a speeder I really liked,\n\t\t\twith an open cockpit... and with\n\t\t\tthe right speed capabilities...\n\t\t\tand then you know I had to get a\n\t\t\treally gonzo color...\n\nThey zoom upward in hot pursuit of ZAM asshe fires out the open window at them with her laser pistol.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tIf you'd spend as much time\n\t\t\tworking on your saber skills as\n\t\t\tyou do on your wit, young Padawan,\n\t\t\tyou would rival Master Yoda as a\n\t\t\tswordsman.\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tI thought I already did.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tOnly in your mind, my very young\n\t\t\tapprentice. Careful!! Hey, easy!!\n\nAs this conversation is going on, ANAKIN deftly moves in and out of the oncoming traffic, across lanes, between buildings, and miraculously through a construction site. ZAM WESELL continues firing at them.\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tSorry, I forgot you don't like\n\t\t\tflying, Master.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tI don't mind flying... but\n\t\t\twhat you're doing is suicide!\n\nThey barely miss a commuter train\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tMaster, you know I've been flying\n\t\t\tsince before I could walk. I'm very\n\t\t\tgood at this.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tJust slow down!\n\nZAM WESSEL and the JEDI race through a line of cross-traffic made up of giant trucks. The speeders bank sideways as they slide around right-angle turns between buildings. ZAM races into a tram tunnel.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\t\tWait! Don't go in there!\n\nANAKIN zooms into the tunnel after ZAM. They see a tram coming at them. They brake, turn around, and race out, barely ahead of the charging commuter transport.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\t\tYou know I don't like it when you\n\t\t\tdo that!\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tSorry, Master. Don't worry, this\n\t\t\tguy's gonna kill himself any\n\t\t\tminute now!\n\nZAM WESSEL turns into oncoming traffic, deliberately trying to throw the JEDI off. Oncoming speeders swerve, trying to avoid ZAM and the JEDI. ZAM does a quick, tight loop-over and ends up behind the JEDI. She is now in a much better position to fire at them with her laser pistol. To avoid being hit by the laser bolts, ANAKIN slams on the brakes and moves alongside ZAM. She now fires point-blank at OBI-WAN.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tWhat are you doing? He's gonna\n\t\t\tblast me!\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tRight - this isn't working.\n\nANAKIN slides underneath Zam's speeder. They race along in traffic, one speeder right on top of the other. The BOUNTY HUNTER skims over the rooftops, causing ANAKIN to drop behind. ANAKIN goes through his gears, zooming around traffic. They race at high speed across a wide, flat surface of the city planet. A large spacecraft almost collides with them as it attempts to land. They round a corner and clip a flag, which gets caught on one of the front air scoops.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tThat was too close!\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tClear that!\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tWhat??\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tClear the flag! We're losing\n\t\t\tpower! Hurry!\n\nOBI-WAN leans out of the speeder, then crawls out onto the front engine, pulling the flag free of the scoop. The speeder lurches forward with a surge of power.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tWhooooaaa! Don't do that! I\n\t\t\tdon't  like it when you do that!\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tSo sorry, Master.\n\nThey chase the BOUNTY HUNTER through a power refinery.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tIt's dangerous near those power\n\t\t\tcouplings! Slow down! Don't go\n\t\t\tthrough there!\n\nHuge electrical bolts shoot between the buildings as the speeders pass.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\t\tYiiii, what are you doing?\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tSorry, Master!\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\t\t(sarcastically)\n\t\t\tOh, that was good...\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tThat was crazy!!!\n\nZAM slides around a corner sideways, blocking an alley, firing point-blank as ANAKIN approaches.\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\t\tAhh, damn.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tStop!!\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tNo, we can make it.\n\nANAKIN barely misses the BOUNTY HUNTER'S speeder as he dives under it, and through a small gap in the building hitting several pipes and going wildly out of control. ANAKIN struggles to regain control of the speeder, narrowly missing a crane, barely clipping a pair of giant struts. A giant gasball shoots up, causing ANAKIN to spin and bump a building, stalling the speeder.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tI'm crazy... I'm crazy... I'm\n\t\t\tcrazy.\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tBut it worked... we made it.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\t\t(angrily)\n\t\t\tIt didn't work... we've stalled!\n\t\t\tAnd you almost got us killed!\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tI think we're still alive.\n\nANAKIN works to get the speeder started. It quickly races to life.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\t\t(very angrily)\n\t\t\tIt was stupid!\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\t\t(sheepishly)\n\t\t\tI could have made it...\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\t\t(furious)\n\t\t\tBut you didn't!!! And now we've\n\t\t\tlost him.\n\nSuddenly, there is an ambush. Laser bolts fire everywhere. EXPLOSIONS surround them. They look up to see ZAM WESSEL take off.\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tNo we didn�t...\n\nOut of a cloud of smoke and ball of flames the JEDI tear after ZAM. They are smoking. OBI-WAN slaps out the small fire on the dashboard. ZAM goes up and down, through cross-traffic. There is a near miss as a speeder almost hits them. ZAM turns down and left between two buildings. ANAKIN pulls up and to the right\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tWhere are you going?! He went\n\t\t\tdown there, the other way.\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tThis is a shortcut... I think.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tWhat do you mean, �You think?�\n\t\t\tWhat kind of shortcut?! He went\n\t\t\tcompletely the other way! You�ve\n\t\t\tlost him!\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tMaster, if we keep this chase\n\t\t\tgoing, that creep�s gonna end up\n\t\t\tdeep fried. Personally, I�d very\n\t\t\tmuch like to find out who in the\n\t\t\thell he is and who he�s working\n\t\t\tfor...\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\t\t(sarcastic)\n\t\t\tOh, so that�s why we�re going in\n\t\t\tthe wrong direction.\n\nANAKIN turns up a side street, zooming up several small passageways, then stops, hovering about fifty stories up.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\t\tWell, you lost him.\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tI�m deeply sorry, Master.\n\nANAKIN looks around front and back. He spots something. He seems to \nstart counting to himself as he watches something below approach.\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\t\tExcuse me for a moment.\n\nANAKIN jumps out of the speeder. OBI-WAN looks down and sees Zam�s speeder about five stories below them cruising past. ANAKIN miraculously lands on top of the Bounty Hunter�s speeder. The speeder wobbles under the impact. ZAM looks up and realises what has happened.\n\nZAM takes off, and ANAKIN slides to the back strut and almost slips off, but manages to hang on. ANAKIN works his way back to the speeder�s cockpit, just as ZAM stops suddenly, and ANAKIN flies forward to the left front fork. ZAM shoots at him with a laser pistol. There is a BLAST near ANAKIN'S hand, which breaks off a piece of the speeder. ANAKIN slides to the right fork of the speeder, where ZAM can�t reach him. He scrambles to the top, holding onto an air scoop.\n\nOBI-WAN has jumped into the driver�s seat of his speeder and is deftly gaining on the rogue speeder. The two speeders dive through oncoming traffic and then through cross traffic. Finally, ANAKIN is able to get hold of his lightsaber and starts to cut his way through the roof of the speeder. ZAM takes out her laser pistol and starts firing at the helpless JEDI, knocking the sword out of his hand. OBI-WAN races under the speeder and catches the Jedi weapon in the passenger�s seat.\n\nANAKIN sticks his hand into the cockpit and, using the Force, pulls the gun out of ZAM�S hand. She grabs the Jedi�s hand, and they struggle for the weapon. It goes off, blowing a hole in the floor of the speeder. The speeder careens wildly out of control. ZAM struggles to pull the speeder out of it�s nose dive. OBI-WAN gets slowed down by traffic and loses sight of the Bounty Hunter�s speeder.\n\nJust as the dragster is about to nose dive into the ground, ZAM pulls it out, and it slides hard on the pavement in a shower of sparks. ANAKIN goes flying into the street.",
