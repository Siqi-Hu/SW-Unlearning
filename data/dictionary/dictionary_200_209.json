It's been\n               so... quiet.\n\n     Biggs looks around then leans close to Luke.\n\n                         BIGGS\n               Luke, I didn't come back just to\n               say good-bye... I shouldn't tell\n               you this, but you're the only one I\n               can trust... and if I don't come\n               back, I want somebody to know.\n\n     Luke's eyes are wide with Biggs' seriousness and loyalty.\n\n                    LUKE\n          What are you talking about?\n\n                    BIGGS\n          I made some friends at the Academy.\n              (he whispers)\n          ...when our frigate goes to one of\n          the central systems, we're going to\n          jump ship and join the Alliance...\n\nLuke, amazed and stunned, is almost speechless.\n\n                    LUKE\n          Join the Rebellion?! Are you\n          kidding! How?\n\n                    BIGGS\n          Quiet down will ya! You got a mouth\n          bigger than a meteor crater!\n\n                    LUKE\n          I'm sorry. I'm quiet.\n              (he whispers)\n          Listen how quiet I am. You can\n          barely hear me...\n\nBiggs shakes his head angrily and then continues.\n\n                    BIGGS\n          My friend has a friend on Bestine\n          who might help us make contact.\n\n                    LUKE\n          You're crazy! You could wander\n          around forever trying to find them.\n\n                    BIGGS\n          I know it's a long shot, but if I\n          don't find them I'll do what I can\n          on my own... It's what we always\n          talked about. Luke, I'm not going\n          to wait for the Empire to draft me\n          into service. The Rebellion is\n          spreading and I want to be on the\n          right side -- the side I believe\n          in.\n\n                    LUKE\n          And I'm stuck here...\n\n                    BIGGS\n          I thought you were going to the\n          Academy next term. You'll get your\n          chance to get off this rock.\n\n          LUKE\nNot likely! I had to cancel my\napplication. There has been a lot\nof unrest among the Sandpeople\nsince you left... they've even\nraided the outskirts of Anchorhead.\n\n          BIGGS\nYour uncle could hold off a whole\ncolony of Sandpeople with one\nblaster.\n\n          LUKE\nI know, but he's got enough\nvaporators going to make the place\npay off. He needs me for just one\nmore season. I can't leave him now.\n\n          BIGGS\nI feel for you, Luke, you're going\nto have to learn what seems to be\nimportant or what really is\nimportant. What good is all your\nuncle's work if it's taken over by\nthe Empire?... You know they're\nstarting to nationalize commerce in\nthe central systems... it won't be\nlong before your uncle is merely a\ntenant, slaving for the greater\nglory of the Empire.\n\n          LUKE\nIt couldn't happen here. You said\nit yourself. The Empire won't\nbother with this rock.\n\n          BIGGS\nThings always change.\n\n          LUKE\nI wish I was going... Are you going\nto be around long?\n\n          BIGGS\nNo, I'm leaving in the morning...\n\n          LUKE\nThen I guess I won't see you.\n\n          BIGGS\nMaybe someday... I'll keep a\nlookout.\n\n                         LUKE\n               Well, I'll be at the Academy next\n               season... after that who knows. I\n               won't be drafted into the Imperial\n               Starfleet that's for sure... Take\n               care of yourself, you'll always be\n               the best friend I've got.\n\n                         BIGGS\n               So long, Luke.\n\n     Biggs turns away from his old friend and heads towards the\n     power station.\n\n21",

Artoo moves cautiously through the\n     creepy rock canyon, inadvertently making a loud clicking\n     noise as he goes. He hears a distant, hard, metallic sound\n     and stops for a moment. Convinced he is alone, he continues\n     on his way.\n\n     In the distance, a pebble tumbles down   the steep canyon wall\n     and a small dark figure darts into the   shadows. A little\n     further up the canyon a slight flicker   of light reveals a\n     pair of eyes in the dark recesses only   a few feet from the\n     narrow path.\n\n     The unsuspecting robot waddles along the rugged trail until\n     suddenly, out of nowhere, a powerful magnetic ray shoots out\n     of the rocks and engulfs him in an eerie glow. He manages\n     one short electronic squeak before he topples over onto his\n     back. His bright computer lights flicker off, then on, then\n     off again. Out of the rocks scurry three Jawas, no taller\n     than Artoo. They holster strange and complex weapons as they\n     cautiously approach the robot. They wear grubby cloaks and\n     their faces are shrouded so only their glowing eyes can be\n     seen. They hiss and make odd guttural sounds as they heave\n     the heavy robot onto their shoulders and carry him off down\n     the trail.\n\n22",
