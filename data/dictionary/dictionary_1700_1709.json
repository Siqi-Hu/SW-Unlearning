General Veers enters the room and\n     approaches the silent, unmoving Vader. Although seemingly\n     very sure of himself, Veers is still not bold enough to\n     interrupt the meditating lord.

He glances warily at the struggling\n     Admiral Ozzel who, with a final choke, stumbles and falls in\n     a lifeless heap before him.\n\n36",
