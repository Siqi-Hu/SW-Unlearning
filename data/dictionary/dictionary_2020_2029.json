        "passage": "Darth Vader walks down the ramp of the shuttle onto the\n     platform, into an elevator, and appears on a ramp on a lower\n     level. He walks toward another ramp exit and is met by two\n     troopers and a commander with Luke, in binders, at their\n     center. The young Jedi gazes at Vader with complete calm.\n\n                         COMMANDER\n               This is a Rebel that surrendered to\n               us. Although he denies it, I\n               believe there may be more of them,\n               and I request permission to conduct\n               a further search of the area.\n\nThe commander extends his hand, revealing Luke's lightsaber.\n\n                    COMMANDER (CONT’D)\n          He was armed only with this.\n\nVader looks at Luke, turns away and faces the commander,\ntaking the lightsaber from the commander's hand.\n\n                    VADER\n          Good work, Commander. Leave us.\n          Conduct your search and bring his\n          companions to me.\n\n                    COMMANDER\n          Yes, my Lord.\n\nThe officer and troops withdraw. Vader and Luke are left\nstanding alone in the oddly tranquil beauty of the place. The\nsounds of the forest filter in upon them.\n\n                    VADER\n          The Emperor has been expecting you.\n\n                    LUKE\n          I know, father.\n\n                    VADER\n          So, you have accepted the truth.\n\n                    LURE\n          I've accepted the truth that you\n          were once Anakin Skywalker, my\n          father.\n\n                    VADER (TURNING TO FACE HIM)\n          That name no longer has any meaning\n          for me.\n\n                    LUKE\n          It is the name of your true self.\n          You've only forgotten. I know there\n          is good in you. The Emperor hasn't\n          driven it from you fully. That is\n          why you couldn't destroy me. That's\n          why you won't bring me to your\n          Emperor now.\n\nVader looks down from Luke to the lightsaber in his own black-\ngloved hand. He seems to ponder Luke's words.\n\n                    VADER (INDICATING LIGHTSABER)\n          I see you have constructed a new\n          lightsaber.\n\nVader ignites the lightsaber and holds it to examine its\nhumming, brilliant blade.\n\n                    VADER (CONT’D)\n          Your skills are complete. Indeed,\n          you are powerful, as the Emperor\n          has foreseen.\n\nThey stand for a moment, the Vader extinguishes the\nlightsaber.\n\n                    LUKE\n          Come with me.\n\n                    VADER\n          Obi-Wan once thought as you do.\n\nLuke steps close to Vader, then stops. Vader is still.\n\n                    VADER (CONT’D)\n          You don't know the power of the\n          dark side. I must obey my master.\n\n                    LUKE\n          I will not turn...and you'll be\n          forced to kill me.\n\n                    VADER\n          If that is your destiny.\n\n                    LUKE\n          Search your feelings, father. You\n          can't do this. I feel the conflict\n          within you. Let go\n\nof your hate.\n\n                    VADER\n          It is too late for me, son. The\n          Emperor will show you the true\n          nature of the Force. He is\n\nyour master now.\n\nVader signals to some distant stormtroopers. He and Luke\nstand staring at one another for a long moment.\n\n                    LUKE\n          Then my father is truly dead.\n\n79",
