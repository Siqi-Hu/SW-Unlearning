Standing at   his side and slightly\n      behind him   is Boba Fett, the bounty   hunter.\n\n      Faster than the wink of an eye, Han draws his blaster and\n      pops off a couple of shots directly at Vader. The Dark Lord\n      quickly raises his hand, deflecting the bolts into one of\n      the side walls, where they explode harmlessly. Just as\n      quickly, Han's weapon zips into Vader's hand. The evil\n      presence calmly places the gun on the table in front of him.\n\n                             VADER\n                   We would be honored if you would\n                   join us.\n\n      Han gives Lando a mean look.\n\n                           LANDO\n                 I had no choice. They arrived\n                 right before you did. I'm sorry.\n\n                           HAN\n                 I'm sorry, too.\n\n204",
