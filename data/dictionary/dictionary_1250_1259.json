Rey reacts, stunned. It takes a moment\n          before she regains her own mask of defiance.\n\n                          KYLO REN\n           Tell me about the droid.\n\n                          REY\n           (a nervous beat)\n           He's a BB unit with a selenium drive\n           and a thermal hyperscan vindicator --\n\n                          KYLO REN\n           He's carrying a section of a\n           navigational chart. We have the\n           rest, recovered from archives of the\n           Empire. We need the last piece.\n           And somehow, you convinced the droid\n           to show it to you. You.

Kylo Ren moves closer,\n          his hand rising toward her. She recoils, but has nowhere to\n          go. Kylo Ren nearly TOUCHES HER FACE...\n          THEY'RE BOTH SURPRISED: they react to a feeling that passes\n          between them -- AN ENERGY THEY RECOGNIZE IN EACH OTHER.\n          And then it's gone. Adversaries again. Rey can't move,\n          quietly strains in agony, trying to resist Ren's probing.\n\n           KYLO REN (CONT'D)\n           ... You're so lonely... so afraid to\n           leave...\n           (then, slight smile)\n           At night, desperate to sleep... you\n           imagine an ocean. I see it -- I see\n           the island...\n          Tears stream down her face as she resists. She tries to\n          break free, but can't budge.\n\n           KYLO REN (CONT'D)\n           And Han Solo. You feel like he's\n           the father you never had.

It's in\n           there... and now you'll give it to\n           me. Don't be afraid.

She meets his gaze --\n\n          DESPITE THE PAIN SHE IS STRONG.\n          On Ren's face as HIS CONFIDENCE BEGINS TO MELT AWAY. He has\n          slammed up against a barrier in her mind. He looks less\n          certain by the moment as Rey seems to GROW IN STRENGTH. The\n          FEROCITY of confrontation builds until it hits critical mass\n\n          AND REY DOES THE UNTHINKABLE! SHE ENTERS HIS HEAD, AMAZED\n\n          AT WHAT SHE IS SEEING!\n\n                          REY\n           ... You... you're afraid... that you\n           will never be as strong as...
